<h1>TESSA WADSWORTH’S DISCIPLINE.</h1>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span><a name='ch1' id='ch1'></a>I.—HEARTS THAT SEEMED TO DIFFER.</h2>
<p>
She was standing one afternoon on the broad piazza,
leaning against the railing, with color enough
in her usually colorless cheeks as she watched the
tall figure passing through the low gateway; he
turned towards the watching eyes, smiled, and
touched his hat.
</p>
<p>
“You will be in again this week,” she said coaxingly,
“you can give me ten minutes out of your
busy-ness.”
</p>
<p>
“Twice ten, perhaps.”
</p>
<p>
The light that flashed into her eyes was her
only reply; she stood leaning forward, playing
with the oleander blossoms under her hand until
he had seated himself in his carriage and driven
away; not until the brown head and straw hat
had disappeared behind the clump of willows at
the corner did she stir or move her eyes, then the
happy feet in the bronze slippers tripped up-stairs
to her own chamber. Dinah had left her slate on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>
a chair, and dropped her algebra on the carpet, at
the sound of Norah’s voice below the window.
</p>
<p>
Tessa was glad to be alone; she was always
glad to be alone after Ralph Towne had left her, to
think over all that he had said, and to feel again
the warm shining of his brown eyes; to thank God
with a few, low, joyful exclamations that He had
brought this friend into her life; and then, as foolish
women will, she must look into her own face
and try to see it as he saw it,—cheeks aglow, tremulous
lips, and such a light in the blue eyes!
</p>
<p>
She did not know that her eyes could look like
that. She had thought them pale, cold, meaningless,
and now they were like no eyes that she had
ever looked into; a dancing, tender, blue delight.
</p>
<p>
Had he read her secret in them?
</p>
<p>
Her enthusiasm with its newness, sweetness, and
freshness,—for it was as fresh as her heart was
pure,—was moulding all her thoughts, strengthening
her desire to become in all things true and
womanly, and making her as blithe all day long
as the birds that twittered in the apple-tree near
her chamber window.
</p>
<p>
It mattered not how her hands were busied so
long as her heart could be full of him. And he,
Ralph Towne, blind and obtuse as any man would
be who lived among books and not in the world at
all, and more than a trifle selfish, as men sometimes
find themselves to be, little thinking of the
effect of his chance visits and fitful attentions,
had in the last two months come to a knowledge
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
that grieved him; for he was an honorable man, he
loved God and reverenced womankind. He had
not time now to think of any thing but the book
for which he was collecting material. It was something
in the natural history line, he had once told
her, but he never cared to speak of it; indeed Ralph
Towne cared to talk but of few things; but she
loved to talk and he loved to listen. He loved to
listen to her, but he did not love her (so he assured
himself), he only loved her presence, as he loved
the sunshine, and he did not love the sunshine
well enough to fret when the day was gloomy; in
these days he did not love any body or any thing
but himself, his books, and his mother.
</p>
<p>
Dunellen said that he was proud of his money
and proud of a great-great-grandmother who had
been cousin to one of the president’s wives; but
Tessa knew that he was not proud of any thing
but his beautiful white-haired mother.
</p>
<p>
Not understanding the signs of love, how could
he know that Tessa Wadsworth was growing to
love <em>him</em>; he had never thought of himself as particularly
worth loving. Surely she knew a dozen
men who were handsomer (if that were what she
cared for), and another dozen who could talk and
tell stories and say pretty things to women (if <em>that</em>
were what attracted her); still he knew to-day that
his presence and light talk (he did not remember
that he had said any thing to be treasured) had
moved her beyond her wont. She was usually
only self-contained and dignified; but to-day there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>
must have been some adequate cause for her changing
color, for the lighting and deepening of her
eyes as they met his so frankly; he was sure to-day
of what he had only surmised before,—that
this sensitive, high-spirited, pure-hearted woman
loved him as it had never entered his preoccupied
mind or selfish heart to love her or indeed any
human being.
</p>
<p>
“I have been a fool!” he ejaculated. “Well, it is
done, and, with a woman like her, it can not be undone!
Miserable bungler that I am, I have been
trying to make matters better, and I have made
them a thousand times worse! Why did I promise
to call again this week? Why did I give her a
right to ask me? I wish that I had <em>never</em> seen
her! God knows,”—she would never have forgotten
his eyes could she have seen them at this instant,
penitent and self-reproachful,—“that I did
not <em>mean</em> to trifle with her.”
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, resting in Dinah’s chair, with the
algebra and slate at her feet, she was thinking
over and over the words he had spoken that afternoon;
very few they were, but simple and sincere;
at least so they sounded to her. She smiled as
“I <em>do</em> care very much” repeated itself to her, with
the tone and the raising of the eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Very much!” as much as she did? It was
about a trifle, some little thing that she had put
into rhyme for him; how many rhymes she had
written for him this summer! He so often said,
“Write this up for me,” and she had so intensely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
enjoyed the doing it, and so intensely enjoyed his
appreciation—his over-appreciation, she always
thought.
</p>
<p>
O, Tessa, Tessa, pick up that algebra, and go
to work with it. Life’s problems are too complex
for your unworldliness.
</p>
<p>
She stooped to pick up Dinah’s slate, and, instead
of finishing the work upon it, she wrote out
rapidly a thought that had tinged her cheeks while
Ralph Towne had been with her. <em>The silent side</em>
she called it. Was it the silent side? If it were,
how was it that he understood? She <em>knew</em> that
he understood; she knew that he had understood
when he answered, “Twice ten, perhaps.”
</p>
<p>
Her mother’s voice below broke in upon her reverie;
fancy, sentiment, or delicate feeling of any
kind died a hard and sudden death under Mrs.
Wadsworth’s influence, yet she read more novels
than did either of her daughters, and would cry
her lovely eyes red and swollen over a story that
Tessa would not deign to skip through. It was
one of her mother’s plaints that Tessa had no
feeling.
</p>
<p>
Ralph Towne did not give the promised “twice
ten” minutes that week, nor for weeks afterward;
she met him several times driving with his mother,
or with his mother and Sue Greyson: her glad,
quick look of recognition was acknowledged by a
lifting of the hat and a “good afternoon, Miss Tessa.”
Once she met him alone with Sue Greyson.
Sue’s saucy, self-congratulatory toss of the head
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
stung her so that she could have cried out. “I
am ashamed”—no, I am not ashamed to tell you
that she cried herself to sleep that night, as she
asked God to bless Ralph Towne and make him
happy and good. She could not have loved Ralph
Towne if she might not have prayed for him. Her
mother would have been inexpressibly shocked at
such a mixture of “love and religion.”
</p>
<p>
“How long have you loved Christ?” asked the
minister, when Tessa was “examined” for admission
to the church.
</p>
<p>
“Ever since I have known Him,” was the timid
reply.
</p>
<p>
And Ralph Towne, in these miserable days, for
he <em>was</em> miserable, as miserable in his fashion as she
was in hers, was blaming her and excusing himself.
What <em>had</em> he ever said to her? Was every
one of a man’s words to be counted? There was
Sue Greyson, why didn’t she turn sentimental about
him? True, he had said one day when they were
talking about friendship—what had he said that
day? Was she remembering that? If she had
studied his words—but of course, she had forgotten!
What had possessed him to say such things?
But how could he look at her and not feel impelled
to say something warm? It could not be his fault;
it must be hers, for leading him on and for remembering
every trivial word. And of that she was
equally sure, for how could he do any man or any
woman wrong, this sincere and honorable Christian
gentleman?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
</p>
<p>
In her imagination there was no one in a book
or out of a book like Ralph Towne. Gus Hammerton
was a scholar and a gentleman, but she had
known him all her life; Felix Harrison was gracious
and good, but he was not like Ralph Towne.
Ralph Towne was not her ideal, he was something
infinitely better than she could think; how beautiful
it was to find some one nobler and grander than
her ideal! Far away in some wonderful, unknown
region he had grown up and had been made ready
for her, and now he had come to meet her; bewildered
and grateful, she had loved him and believed
in him—almost as if that unknown region
were heaven.
</p>
<p>
It was her wildest dream come true; that is,
it had come true, until lately. Some strange thing
was happening; it was happening and almost breaking
her heart.
</p>
<p>
“Tessa, you look horrid nowadays,” exclaimed
Dinah, one afternoon, as Tessa came up on the
piazza, returning from her usual walk. “You are
white, and purple, and all colors, and you never
sing about the house or talk to me or to any body.
You actually ran away while Mrs. Bird was over
here yesterday, and you don’t even go to see Miss
Jewett! She asked me yesterday if you had gone
away. When Laura was talking to you yesterday,
you looked as if you did not hear one word she
said.”
</p>
<p>
“I was listening.”
</p>
<p>
“And you used to have such fun talking to Gus;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
I believe that you went up-stairs while he was here
last night.”
</p>
<p>
“I had a headache; I excused myself.”
</p>
<p>
“You always go down the road. Why don’t you
go through Dunellen?”
</p>
<p>
“I want to get into the country; I never walk
through a street simply for the pleasure of it. I
like to be alone.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you ever walk as far as Old Place?”
</p>
<p>
“That isn’t far, only three miles; sometimes I
go to Mayfield, that is a mile beyond Old Place.”
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t Old Place splendid? Next to Mr. Gesner’s
it is the handsomest place around.”
</p>
<p>
“It is more home-like than Mr. Gesner’s.”
</p>
<p>
“Sue likes Mr. Gesner’s better. I told her that I
would take Old Place and she could have Mr. Gesner’s.
Mr. Gesner’s is stone; Old Place is all wood.
Do you ever see any of the Townes?”
</p>
<p>
“There are not many to be seen.”
</p>
<p>
“Counting Sue, there are three. Sue thinks that
she is stylish, driving around with Mrs. Towne.
She stayed a week with Miss Gesner once, too.
Why don’t you and I get invited around to such
places? Mrs. Towne ought to invite you. Mr.
Towne used to come here often enough.”
</p>
<p>
“Used to come!” Tessa shivered standing in
the sunlight. “Yes, it was ‘used to come,’” she
was thinking. “I have been dreaming, now I am
awake. I wish that I had died while I was dreaming.”
</p>
<p>
“Now you look pale again! I guess you are growing up,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
laughed unconscious Dinah; “it’s hateful
and horrid to grow up; I never shall. Remember
that I am always to be fifteen.”
</p>
<p>
“I hope that you never will grow up,” said Tessa,
earnestly, “every thing is just as bad as you can
dream.”
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Towne has given Sue coral ear-rings,” Dinah
ran on. Tessa had gone down to her flower-bed to
pull a few weeds that had pushed themselves in
among her pansies. “He gave his mother several
groups in stone for the dining-room; they are all
funny, Sue says. In one, some children are playing
doctor; in another, they are playing school. He
gave his cousin a silk dress, and he bought himself
a set of books for his birthday; he was thirty-two.
Did you think he was so old?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“I say, Tessa, Sue thinks that she is going to
marry him.”
</p>
<p>
“Does she?” The voice was away down in the
flowers.
</p>
<p>
“You are always among those flowers. Don’t you
wish that we had a conservatory? They have a
grand one at Old Place. I wonder why they have
so little company.”
</p>
<p>
“Mrs. Towne is feeble; she likes a quiet house.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Sue says that. But Grace Geer, his cousin,
is there! Mrs. Towne is to give Old Place and all
its treasures to Mr. Towne upon his wedding-day;
she wants a daughter more than any thing, Sue
says. I wish she would take me. Sue thinks that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
she will take <em>her</em>. Every other word that she speaks
is ‘Mr. Ralph.’ She talks about him everywhere.
Do <em>you</em> believe it?”
</p>
<p>
“Believe what?”
</p>
<p>
Tessa had returned to the piazza with a bunch
of pansies.
</p>
<p>
“Believe that she will marry him! She has real
pretty manners when she is with them, and really
tries not to talk slang. But I don’t believe it. He
treats her as he would treat any one else; I have
seen them together.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps she will. People say so,” said Tessa.
</p>
<p>
Poor motherless, sisterless Sue! Was she making
a disappointment for herself out of nothing?
Or was it out of a something like hers?
</p>
<p>
It was certainly true that Sue Greyson had taken
a summer tour with Mrs. Towne and Mr. Ralph
Towne, and that she had spent more of her time
during the last year at Old Place than in her own
small, unlovely home. She loved her father “well
enough,” she would have told you; but after the
months at Old Place, she found the cottage in Dunellen
a stale and prosaic affair; her father had old
Aunt Jane to keep house for him, why did he need
her? He would have to do without her some day.
Doctor Lake was great fun, why could he not be
interested in him?
</p>
<p>
“He is a stranger, not my only daughter,” her
father had once replied.
</p>
<p>
“Your father will be glad enough and proud
enough that he let you come to Old Place,” comforted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>
Grace Geer, when Sue told her that he missed
her at home. “Ralph Towne’s wife will be a happy
woman for more reasons than one; and he is interested
in you, as one can see at a glance. He told
his mother to-day that he should always be glad
that they had come to Old Place.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span><a name='ch2' id='ch2'></a>II.—THE SILENT SIDE.</h2>
<p>
It was nearly six weeks after the day that she
had watched him as far as the clump of willows
that he came again. Sue Greyson had driven him
into Dunellen that morning and had stopped at the
gate on her return to tell her about her “grand
splendid, delightful times” at Old Place.
</p>
<p>
“Cousin Grace has gone away; how we miss her
music! Mr. Ralph did not care for it, but Mrs.
Towne and I cared. Mrs. Towne says that I ought
to have a music teacher; but I never did practice
when I had one. I can’t apply my mind to any
thing; Mr. Ralph says that I learn by observation.
I wonder why wise men choose silly wives always,”
she added consciously, playing with the reins.
</p>
<p>
“Do they?” asked Tessa, picking a lilac leaf from
the shrubbery.
</p>
<div class='figcenter' style='padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em'>

<span class='caption'>“Is not this what we usually call the Indian summer?”<br/>said Tessa, as she extended her hand.</span>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span></div>
<p>
“Cousin Grace says so. I wish I knew what ails
Mr. Ralph. His mother says that he is having a
worry; she always knows when he is having a worry
by his eyes; they do look very melancholy, and last
night I overheard him say to Mrs. Towne, ‘A man
has to keep his eyes pretty wide open not to step
on peoples’ toes.’ I didn’t think much of that, but
he said afterward, ‘A man may do in an hour what
he can’t <em>undo</em> in a lifetime.’ He never talks much,
so I know that something is on his mind, or he would
not have talked so long. She said that he must be
patient and do right.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, Sue, you did not listen!”
</p>
<p>
“Of course not. They were in the library, and
I was on the balcony outside the window. I heard
his voice—he was walking up and down, and, I
confess, I <em>did</em> want to know what it was all about!
I thought that it might be about me, you know.
But I can’t stay here all day; Mrs. Towne is to take
me to spend the day with the Gesners. It is splendid
there. Mr. John Gesner I don’t like, but Mr.
Lewis Gesner treats me so respectfully and talks
to me as if he liked to hear me talk. And Miss
Gesner is loveliness personified! Mr. Towne said
that he had a call to make this afternoon, and
would walk home. He will be up in the four
o’clock train.”
</p>
<p>
“A call to make!”
</p>
<p>
The words were in her ears all day; she dressed
for her walk, then concluded to stay at home.
How could he undo what he had so thoughtlessly,
so mercilessly, done? Would he come and talk to
her as he had talked to his mother? Would he
say, “I am sorry that you have misinterpreted
my words?” Misinterpreted! Did they not both
speak English? Sincere, straightforward, frank
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
English? It was the only language that she
knew. In what tongue had he spoken to her?
</p>
<p>
Her fluttering reverie was brought to a sudden
and giddy end; the sound of a firm tread on the
dried leaves under the maple-trees outside the
gate, a tall figure in plain, elegant black,—the
startled color in her eyes told the rest; she sprang
to her feet, dropped her long, white work, shook
off all outward nervousness, brushed her hair,
fastened a bow of blue ribbon down low on her
braids, questioned her eyes and lips to ascertain if
they were <em>safe</em>, and then passed down the stair-way
with a light, sure tread, and stood on the
piazza to welcome Ralph Towne; her own composed,
womanly self, rather more self-repressed
than usual, and with a slight stateliness that she
had never assumed with him. But he only noted
that she appeared well and radiant; he understood
her no more—than he understood several other
things. Ralph Towne had been called “slow”
from his babyhood.
</p>
<p>
“Is not this what we usually call the Indian
summer? We have not had frost yet, I think,”
she said easily.
</p>
<p>
His dark face crimsoned, he answered briefly,
and dropped her hand.
</p>
<p>
If he had ever prided himself upon his tact, he
was aware that to-day it would be a most miserable
failure. How could he say, “You have misunderstood
me,” when perhaps it was he who had
misunderstood her? He had come to her to-day
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
by sheer force of will, not daring to stay away
longer—and what had he come for? To assure her—perhaps
he did not intend to assure her any
thing; perhaps it was not necessary to assure her
any thing. Not very long ago he <em>had</em> assured
her that he could become to her her “ideal of a
friend,” if she would “show” him how. Poor Tessa!
This showing him how was weary work.
“Yes,” he replied, wheeling a chair nearer the
open window, “the country is beautiful.”
</p>
<p>
That look about her flexible lips was telling its
own story; she was just the woman, he reasoned,
to break her heart about such a fellow as he was.
</p>
<p>
“I have very little time for any thing outside
my work,” he said, running on with his mental
comments. All a man had to do to make himself
a hero was to let a woman like this fall in love
with him.
</p>
<p>
“What have <em>you</em> been doing?” he asked in his
tone of sincere interest.
</p>
<p>
“All my own doings,” she said lightly. “Mr.
Hammerton and I have been writing a criticism
upon a novel and comparing notes, and I have
sewed, as all ladies do, and walked.”
</p>
<p>
“You are an English girl about walking.”
</p>
<p>
“I know every step of the way between Dunellen
and Mayfield. Do <em>you</em> walk?”
</p>
<p>
“No, I drive. My life has a lack. My book is
falling through. I do not find much in life.”
</p>
<p>
“Our best things are nearest to us, close about
our feet,” she answered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
</p>
<p>
He did not reply. Ralph Towne never replied
unless he chose.
</p>
<p>
He opened his watch; he had been with her
exactly ten minutes.
</p>
<p>
“I have an engagement at six,” he said.
</p>
<p>
The flexible lips stiffened. “Do not let me detain
you.”
</p>
<p>
He was regarding her with a smile in his eyes
that she could not interpret; her graceful head
was thrown back against the mass of fluffy white
upon the chair, the white softening the outlines
of a face that surely needed not softening; the
clear, unshrinking eyes meeting his with all her
truth in them; the blue ribbon at her throat, the
gray cashmere falling around her, touched him
with a sense of fitness; the slight hands clasping
each other in her lap, slight even with their
strength, partly annoyed, partly baffled him. Mr.
Hammerton had told her that she had wilful
hands.
</p>
<p>
Regarding Tessa Wadsworth as regarding some
other things, Ralph Towne thought because he felt;
he could not think any further than he thought
to-day, because he had not felt any further.
</p>
<p>
There was another friend in her life who with
Tessa Wadsworth as with some other things felt
because he thought, and he could not feel any further
than he felt to-day because he had not thought
any further.
</p>
<p>
For the first time since she had known Ralph
Towne, she was wishing that he were like Gus
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>
Hammerton. It had never occurred to her before
to wish that he would change.
</p>
<p>
Each smiled under the survey. He was thinking,
“I wish I loved you.” She was thinking,
“You are a dear, big boy; I wish you were more
manly.”
</p>
<p>
“You did not send me the poem you promised.”
</p>
<p>
“You said you would come soon.”
</p>
<p>
“Did you expect me?”
</p>
<p>
“Had I any reason to doubt your word?”
</p>
<p>
“You must not take literally all I say,” he answered
with irritation.
</p>
<p>
“I have learned that. I have studied the world’s
arithmetic, but I do not use it to solve any word
of yours, any more than I have supposed that you
would use it to find the meaning of any problem
you might discover in my attitude towards you.”
</p>
<p>
“It is best not to dig and delve for a meaning,
Miss Tessa; society sanctions many phrases that
you would not speak in sincerity.”
</p>
<p>
“Society!” she repeated in a tone that brought
the color to his forehead. “Is society my law-giver?”
</p>
<p>
It was very pleasant to be loved by a woman like
this woman; he could not understand her, but she
touched him like the perfume of the white rose, or
the note of the thrush. His next words were sincere
and abrupt. “You asked me some time since
to burn the package of poems you have written for
me. If I had done as much for you, would you
destroy them?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>
</p>
<p>
A flush, a dropping of the eyes, and a low laugh
answered him.
</p>
<p>
He arose quickly, with a motion of tossing off an
ugly sensation. “I am very much engaged; I do
not know when I can come again. We are going
west for the winter.”
</p>
<p>
She could not lift her eyes, or speak, or catch her
breath. She arose, slowly, as if the movement
were almost too great an effort, and stood leaning
against the tall chair, her fingers fumbling with
the fringe of the tidy; the room had become so
darkened that the white fringe was but a dark
outline of something that she could feel.
</p>
<p>
“Sue Greyson is to accompany my mother; I
shall be much away, and I do not like to leave her
with strangers.”
</p>
<p>
“Sue is pleasant and lively.” She had spoken,
and now she could, not quite clearly yet, but a
glance revealed the blood surging to his forehead,
the veins swollen in his temples, even through the
heavy mustache she discerned the twitching of his
lips. The pain in her heart had opened her eyes
wide. Had he come to make the parting final?
What had she done that he should thus thrust her
away outside of all the interests in his life? Did
he know how she cared, and was he so sorry? Was
he trying to be “patient,” as his mother had advised—patient
with her for taking him at his
word?
</p>
<p>
Dunellen had called her proud; this instant she
was as humble as a child.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
</p>
<p>
Slowly and sorrowfully she said, “Come again—some
time.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” he said, as slowly and as sorrowfully, “I
will.”
</p>
<p>
He was very sorry for this woman who had been
so foolish as to think that his words had meant so
much.
</p>
<p>
She had closed the street door and was on the
first step of the stairs when her mother called to
her from the sitting-room.
</p>
<p>
“What did Sir Dignified Undemonstrative have
to say for himself?”
</p>
<p>
“He does not talk about himself.”
</p>
<p>
“It is your turn to get tea! It is Bridget’s afternoon
out.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Wadsworth was a little lady something less
than five feet in height, as slight as a girl of twelve,
and prettier than either of her daughters; with
brown hair, brown eyes, and the sprightliest manner
possible.
</p>
<p>
“Young enough to be Tessa’s sister,” Dunellen
declared.
</p>
<p>
But she was neither sister nor mother as her
elder daughter defined the words.
</p>
<p>
“If you get him, Tessa, you’ll get a catch,” remarked
Mrs. Wadsworth watching the effect of her
words.
</p>
<p>
The first sound of her mother’s voice had brought
her to herself, her self-contained, cautious and,
oftentimes, sarcastic self.
</p>
<p>
“Have you any order about tea?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
</p>
<p>
Her studied respect toward her mother, was
pitiful sometimes. It was hard that she could not
attain somewhat of her ideal of daughterhood.
</p>
<p>
“No, but I want you to do an errand for me after
tea. I forgot to ask Dine to do it on her way from
school.”
</p>
<p>
“Very well,” she assented obediently.
</p>
<p>
She stumbled on the basement stairs, and found
the kitchen so dark that she groped her way to
a chair and sank into it, dropping her head on the
table. She could hear nothing, see nothing, feel
nothing—the whole earth was empty!
</p>
<p>
Where was God? Had He gone, too?
</p>
<p>
Through the open windows floated the sound of
girls’ voices, as Norah and Dinah chatted and
laughed in the garden. But the sound was far
off; the engine whistled and screamed, but the
sound was not in her world; carriages rolled past,
the front gate swung to, her father’s step was on
the piazza over her head, and he was calling, her
dear old father, “Where are you all, my three
girls?”
</p>
<p>
His fulfilled hope was bitterer than all her disappointments
ever could be.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t wonder,” she said with a sob in her
throat, as she arose and pushed her hair back, “I
don’t wonder that he can not love me; but oh, I
wish that he had not told me a lie!”
</p>
<p>
October passed; the days hurried into November;
there was no more leaf-hunting for her, no more
long walks down the beautiful country road, no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
more tripping up and down stairs with a song or
a hymn on her lips, no more of life, she would
have said, for every thing seemed like death. She
did not die with shame, as at first she was sure
that she would do; she could not run away to the
far end of the earth where she would never again
see his face; where every face would be a new face,
where no voice would speak his name; she could
not dig a hole in the earth and creep into it; she
could not lie down at night and shut her tired eyes,
with both hands under her cheek, as she always
fell asleep, and never awake again, as she would
love best of all to do; she could cry out, but she
could not hear the answer, “Oh, please tell me
when I <em>meant</em> to be so good, why it had to be so
hard.”
</p>
<p>
No; she had to live in a world where people
would laugh at her if they only knew; how she
would shiver and freeze if her mother should once
begin to harp upon the sudden break. She could
not bemoan herself all the time; she was compelled
to live because she had been born, and she was compelled
to thrive and grow cheery; there were even
moments when she forgot to be ashamed, for her
mother’s winter cough set in with the cold winds,
and beside being nurse, she was in reality the head
of the small household. Dinah was preparing to
be graduated in the summer and was no help at
all; instead, an hour or two every evening Tessa was
asked to study with her, for she did not love study
and was not quick like her sister.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>
</p>
<p>
And then she had her own special work to do, for
she was a scribbler in prose and rhyme; the half
dozen weeklies that came to the house contained
more than once or twice during the year sprightly
or pathetic articles under the initials T. L. W.
</p>
<p>
But few knew of this her “literary streak,” as her
mother styled it, for she dreaded any publicity.
</p>
<p>
Miss Jewett, her father, and Mr. Hammerton were
her sole encouragers and advisers; Mr. Towne was
not aware that she dipped her pen in ink for any
one’s pleasure but his own. Beside this work there
were friends to entertain, half the girldom in Dunellen
were her friends or had been at some time.
</p>
<p>
Ralph Towne often wondered how she was “taking”
it; he could have found no sign of it in her
face or in her life. Her father feared that she was
being overworked. Mr. Hammerton’s short-sighted
eyes noticed a shadow flit across her eyes, sometimes,
when she was talking to him, and said to
himself, “I see her often; I see a change that is not
a change; there is something happening that no
one knows.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span><a name='ch3' id='ch3'></a>III.—THE LAST NIGHT OF THE OLD YEAR.</h2>
<p>
All her life she had longed for personal beauty;
she loved every beautiful thing and she wanted to
love her own face. It was Ralph Towne’s perfect
face that had drawn her to him, his voice, and his
eyes, like the woods in October.
</p>
<p>
She had studied her face times enough by lamplight
and sunlight to know it thoroughly, but she
could not discover the sweetness that Miss Jewett
saw, or the intelligence that delighted her father;
she could find without much searching the freckles
on her nose, the shortness of her upper lip, the two
slight marks that infantile chicken-pox had dented
into her forehead, the upward tendency of her nose,
and the dimple that was only half a dimple in her
chin.
</p>
<p>
She was as pretty and as homely as any of the
fair, blue-eyed girls in Dunellen or elsewhere: with
lips that shaped themselves with every passing feeling;
with eyes that could grow so bright and dark
that one could forget how bright they were; with
the palest of chestnut hair, worn high or low, as
the little world of Dunellen demanded; with hands
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
slight and characteristic; a figure neither tall nor
slender, but perfectly proportioned, rounded and
graceful; arrayed as neatly and becomingly as she
could be on her limited allowance, usually in plain
colors, often in black of a soft texture with a ribbon
of some pale tint at her throat and among her braids.
A stranger might have taken her for any one of the
twenty-three girls in Miss Jewett’s Bible class; that
is any one of the blue-eyed ones who wore gray
vails and gray walking suits.
</p>
<p>
But you and I know better.
</p>
<p>
With her self-depreciation she was one thing that
she was not likely to guess—the prettiest talker in
the world.
</p>
<p>
Felix Harrison had told Miss Jewett so years
ago.
</p>
<p>
“I haven’t any accomplishments,” she often
sighed.
</p>
<p>
“You do not need any,” Mr. Hammerton had
once said.
</p>
<p>
One morning in December she chanced upon a
bundle of old letters in one of Dinah’s drawers,
they were written during the winter that she had
spent in the city two years ago.
</p>
<p>
She drew one from its envelope; it was dated
December 22, just two years ago to-day; she ran
through it eagerly. How often she had remembered
that day as an era; the beginning of the best
things in her uneventful life! The second perusal
was more slow. “I have seen somebody new; he
is a friend of Aunt Dinah’s, or his mother is, or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
was. Don’t you remember that handsome house
near Mayfield, just above Laura’s? When they
were building it, Laura and I used to speculate as
to whom it belonged, and wonder if it would make
any difference to us. She said she would marry
the son (for of course there would be a handsome
and learned son) and that I should come to live
with her forever; and Felix said that he would
buy it for me, some day; you and I used to play
that we owned it but that we preferred to live
nearer Dunellen and had left it in charge of our
housekeeper! How often when the former owner
was in Europe, I have stood outside the gates and
peered in and planned how happy we would all
be there. Father should rest and read, and enjoy
all the beautiful walks and the woods and the
streams in the meadow with the rustic bridge, and
mother should have a coach and four, and you and
Gus and I would have it all.
</p>
<p>
“All this preamble is to introduce the fact that
the somebody new is the owner of Old Place. Isn’t
that an odd name? I don’t like it; I should call it
Maplewood; in the autumn it is nothing but one
glory of maple. His mother named it and they
have become accustomed to its queerness. His
mother is wintering with a relative, an invalid, I
believe; I think that she has taken the invalid to
Florida and the son (the father died long ago) has
come to spend the winter in the city. They say
he is wise and learned (I do not see any evidence
of it, however), but he certainly is a veritable Tawwo
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>
Chikwo, the beauty of the world. Get out my old
Lavengro and read about him.
</p>
<p>
“He is almost as dark as a gypsy, too, his eyes are
the brownest and sunniest. I never saw such eyes
(a sunbeam was lost one day and crept into his eyes
for a home), his hair, beard, and mustache are as
brown as his eyes; as brown, but not at all bright.
</p>
<p>
“He looks like a big boy, but Aunt Dinah says
that he is in the neighborhood of thirty; his life
has left no trace in his face, or perhaps all that
brown hair covers the traces of discipline. His
manner is gentleness and dignity united. But he
can’t talk. Or perhaps he won’t.
</p>
<p>
“His replies (he ventures nothing else) are simple,
good, kind, and above all, <em>sincere</em>. I have a feeling
that I shall believe every word he says. That is
something new for me, too. He doesn’t think
much of me. He likes to hear me talk though; I
have made several bright remarks for the pleasure
of the sunbeam in his eyes.
</p>
<p>
“If I were his mother I should be sorry to do or
say any thing to frighten it away.
</p>
<p>
“I know that he has never been in love; he
could not be such a dear, grave, humorous, gentle,
dignified, stupid big boy if some girl had shaken
him up.
</p>
<p>
“If he were the talker that Gus Hammerton is, I
should go into raptures over him. He is a doctor,
too, but he has not begun practice; he has been
travelling with his mother. Is it not lovely to be
rich enough to do just what you like?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>
</p>
<p>
“Tell Gus that I will answer his letter sometime;
you may let him read this if you like.”
</p>
<p>
This letter she tore into atoms; she glanced over
the others to find Ralph Towne’s name; not once
did she find it.
</p>
<p>
“I will do something to commemorate this anniversary,”
she thought. “I will drop his photograph
into the fire, and tear the fly-leaf out of the
Mrs. Browning he gave me.”
</p>
<p>
Her name and his initials were all that was
written in the book; very carefully she cut out
the entire page.
</p>
<p>
“Why, child! have you seen a ghost?” her
mother exclaimed, meeting her in the hall.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, but it was only a ghost; there was nothing
real about it.”
</p>
<p>
That afternoon, having some sewing to do for
her father, she betook herself to the chilliness of
the parlor grate; her mother was in a fault-find
frame of mind and Tessa’s nerves were ready to be
set on edge at the least provocation.
</p>
<p>
That parlor! She would have wept over its
shabbiness had she ever been able to find tears for
such purposes. Wheeling an arm-chair near enough
to the grate to be made comfortable by all the heat
there was, she placed her feet on the fender and
folded her hands over the work in her lap. It was
a raw day, the sky over Mr. Bird’s house was unsympathetic,
the bare branches in the apple orchard
stretched out in all directions stiff and dry
as if they were never to become green again; the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>
outlook was not cheering, the inlook was little
more so; but how could she wish for any thing
more than her father was able to give his three
dear girls!
</p>
<p>
This room had seemed pretty to her in the summer
when the windows were open and she could
have flowers everywhere; Ralph Towne always
spoke of her flowers, and he had more than once
leaned back in that worn green arm-chair opposite
hers, as if that stiff, low room were the place of all
places that he loved to be in. In dreary contrast
with his own home, how poor and tasteless this
home must be! How the carpet must stare up at
him with its bunches of flowers and leaves upon
its faded gray ground; how plain the white shades
must appear after curtains of real lace; how worn
and yellowish the green rep of the black-walnut
furniture; how few the books in the small bookcase;
and the photographs and engravings upon
the walls, how they must shock him! How meagre
and coarse her dress must be to him after his mother’s
rich attire!
</p>
<p>
She despised herself for pitying herself!
</p>
<p>
Sue Greyson said that Old Place was fairy-land,
but in her catalogue of its attractions she had omitted
the spacious library; his “den,” Mr. Towne
called it. In Tessa’s imagination he was ever in
that room buried among its treasures.
</p>
<p>
Was her photograph in that room? What had
he done with it? Where was he keeping it? How
he had coaxed for it! She had had it taken unwillingly;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
it was altogether too much like giving herself
away; but when she could refuse no longer she
had given it to him. A vignette with all herself
in it; too much of herself for him to understand;
what would he do with it now? Burn it, perhaps,
as she had burned his; but he would not be burning
a ghost, it was her own self, that he had thrown
away.
</p>
<p>
“I should have despised myself forever if I had
not believed in him and been true,” she reasoned.
“I would rather trust in a lie than not believe the
truth. And how could I know that he was not
true!”
</p>
<p>
She took up her work and began to sew, her reverie
running on and running away with her; an
ottoman stood near her, she had laid needlework
and scissors upon it: how many associations there
were clustering around it! It was an ugly looking
thing, too; her mother had worked the cover one
winter years ago when she was kept in by a cough;
the wreath of roses was so unlike roses, and the
parrot that was poised in the centre of the wreath,
on a brown twig, was so ungainly! One night—how
long ago it was—before she had ever seen
Ralph Towne, Felix Harrison had been seated upon
it while he told her with such a warm, shy glance
that he never slept without praying for her. And
Ralph Towne had scattered his photographs over it,
and asked her to choose from among them, saying,
“I should not have had them taken but for you.”
</p>
<p>
The ugly old parrot was dear after all.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
</p>
<p>
“I wonder,” she soliloquized, taking slow stitches,
“if having lost faith in a person, it can ever be
brought back again? If he should come and say
that he has been wrong—”
</p>
<p>
The gate clicked, in an instant she was on her
feet, <em>had</em> he come to confess himself in the wrong?
Oh, how she would forgive and forget! And trust
him?
</p>
<p>
The tall thin figure had a stoop in its shoulders,
Ralph Towne was erect; the overcoat was carelessly
worn, revealing a threadbare vest and loose black
necktie; it was only Dr. Lake, Dr. Greyson’s new
partner.
</p>
<p>
She had been drawn to him the first moment
of their meeting. As soon as he had left after his
first call, she had said to Dinah: “I never felt so
towards any one before; I shall be so sorry for him
to go away where I can not follow him; I want to
put my arms around him and coax him to be good.”
</p>
<p>
“How do you know that he isn’t good?”
</p>
<p>
“I do know it. I do not know how I know. He
hasn’t any ‘women folks’ either. He is as sensitive
to every change in one’s voice as the thermometer
is to changes in the atmosphere. I never saw any
one like him before. When I make a collection of
curiosities I find in Human Nature, I shall certainly
take him for one of the rarest and most interesting.
It would not take two minutes to convert him from
the inquisitor to the martyr at the stake. I feel
as if he were a little child crying with a thorn in
his finger, and he had no mother to take it out.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
</p>
<p>
“He was only here fifteen minutes and he was as
full of fun as he could be; he ran down the piazza,
and he whistled while he was unhitching his horse,
and began to sing as he drove off. Oh, you are so
funny! you hear a man talk slang—he is equal to
Sue Greyson for that—ask mother about her cough,
tell a funny story, and then think his heart is
breaking with a thorn in his finger.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa would not laugh. “I want him to stay;
I don’t want ever to lose him.”
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t he ugly? Such a tall, square forehead.
Did you ever see such a forehead?”
</p>
<p>
“My first thought of him was, ‘oh, how homely
you are.’”
</p>
<p>
But that first thought never recurred; she was
too much attracted by his rapid, easy utterance
and sensitive voice to remember his plain face and
careless attire.
</p>
<p>
She resumed her sewing with a new train of
thought and had forgotten Dr. Lake’s entrance,
when Bridget came to the door with a request
from Mrs Wadsworth; opening the door of the
sitting-room, she found her mother leaning back
in her sewing chair with a plaintive and childish
expression, and Dr. Lake playing with her spools
of silk, sitting in a careless attitude of perfect
grace at her side. Tessa was sorry to have the
picture spoiled by his rising to greet her.
</p>
<p>
“Ralph Towne, M.D.,” he was replying, “he was
born with a gold spoon in his pretty mouth! It
would have been better for him if it had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>
silver-plated like mine. Quit? He’s a mummy, a
cloister, a tomb! I do not quarrel with any man’s
calling,” he continued, winding the black silk
around his fingers, “circumstances have made me
a physician. Calling! It means something only
when circumstances have nothing to do with it.”
</p>
<p>
“Read the lives of the world’s best workers,”
said Tessa.
</p>
<p>
“A glass of water, an empty glass, and a spoon,
if you please, Miss Tessa. Do you remember—I
have forgotten his name—but I assure you that I
am not concocting the story—he rose to eminence
in the medical profession, several rounds higher
in the ladder of fame than I expect to climb—and
his mind was drawn towards medicine when he
was a youngster by the display of gold lace that
his father’s physician flung into the eyes of the
world. Gold lace made that boy a famous doctor.”
Tessa brought the glasses and the water;
in a leisurely manner he counted a certain number
of spoonfuls of water into the empty glass. “I’m
a commonplace fellow! I’m not one of the
world’s workers! Neither is Ralph Towne! To
have an easy life and not do <em>much</em> harm is the
most I hope for in this world; as for the next,
who knows anything about that? I say, ‘Your
tongue, please,’ and drop medicine and make
powders all day long for my bread and butter. I
have no faith in medicine.”
</p>
<p>
“Then you are an impostor! You shall never
see even the tip of my tongue.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
</p>
<p>
He laughed as if it were such fun to laugh.
</p>
<p>
“What is medicine to you?” he asked after
counting forty drops from a vial into the water.
“A woman in a crowd once touched the border of
a certain garment and through faith was healed;
so I take the thing that He has ordained for healing,
all created things are His garment; through
His garment I come nearer to Him and am healed.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Wadsworth looked annoyed. “So I may
take cream instead of cod liver oil, doctor.”
</p>
<p>
“If you prefer it,” he answered carelessly. “Miss
Tessa, you are a Mystic.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa liked to watch the motion of his fingers;
his hands were small, shapely, and every movement
of them struck her as an apt quotation. She
was learning as much of himself from his hands
as from his face.
</p>
<p>
“Now I must go and scold Felix Harrison,” he
said rising. “A teaspoonful in a wineglass of
water three times a day, Mrs. Wadsworth! He
had an attack last night and cheated me out of
my dreams. Do you know him, Mystic? If he
do not leave off brain work he will make a fool
of himself. A gold spoon would not have hurt
him.”
</p>
<p>
He turned suddenly facing Tessa as they stood
alone in the hall; he was seriousness itself now; a
look of care had settled over his features. He was
not a “big boy,” he was a man, undisciplined, it
is true, but a man to whom life meant many disappointments
and hard work.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>
</p>
<p>
“What is the matter with you? Do you ever
go to sleep? If you do not give up thinking and
take to nonsense and novels, I shall be called to
take you through a nervous fever. Mind, I am
in earnest. Don’t spend too much time in washing
the disciples’ feet either; it is very charming to
be St. Theresa, but you are not strong enough.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you. I am well. Is Sue at home?”
</p>
<p>
“No, she stays at Old Place until her knight
departs. He had better go soon or I shall meet
him in the woods. Alone. At midnight. What
is he trifling with her for? Does he intend to
marry her?”
</p>
<p>
Was this his thorn? Could he love a shallow
girl like Sue Greyson?
</p>
<p>
“Ought we to talk about her?” she asked
gently.
</p>
<p>
“You are her friend. You are older than she
is. She will not listen to me. Her father takes
no more care of her than he does of you.”
</p>
<p>
“She has not cared for me lately.”
</p>
<p>
“She does care for you. You must pull her
through this. Towne made a fool of a girl I know—she
is married, though; it didn’t smash her affections
very deep; married rich, too. But it will
be a pity for Sue to have a heartache all for nix;
she is a guileless piece; I would be sorry for her to
have a disappointment.”
</p>
<p>
“Motherless children are always taken care of,”
she answered trying to speak lightly.
</p>
<p>
In the twilight she sat alone at the parlor grate;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>
it was beginning to rain; through the mist the
lights in kitchen and parlor opposite were gleaming;
Dinah and Bridget were laughing in the
basement; a quick, hard cough, then her father’s
voice in a concerned tone sounded through the
stillness.
</p>
<p>
Why was she feeling lonely and as if her heart
would break, unless somebody should come, or unless
somebody gave her something, or unless something
happened? In story-books, when one was
in such a mood, in a misty twilight something
always happened.
</p>
<p>
Why were there not such strong helpers in her
life as women in books always found? Compared
with the grand, good, winning lover in books, what
were the men she knew? Why, Dr. Lake was frivolous,
Felix Harrison weak, Gus Hammerton practical
and pedantic, and Mr. Towne heartless and
stupid!
</p>
<p>
“Gus is here,” said Dinah, her head appearing
at the door, “and he has brought you a book!
But I’m going to read it first.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I’ll come,” she answered. But she did
not go for half an hour; Mr. Hammerton took the
new book to her immediately and talked to her
until her pale cheeks were in a glow.
</p>
<p>
The last day of the year, what a day it was!
</p>
<p>
It was like a mellow day in October; in the
afternoon Tessa found herself wandering through
Mayfield; as she sauntered past the school-house a
voice arrested her, one of the voices that she knew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
best in the world. She stood near the entrance
listening.
</p>
<p>
That thrilling pathetic voice; it had never touched
her as it touched her to-day.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Old&nbsp;&nbsp;year,&nbsp;&nbsp;you&nbsp;&nbsp;shall&nbsp;&nbsp;not&nbsp;&nbsp;die;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We&nbsp;&nbsp;did&nbsp;&nbsp;so&nbsp;&nbsp;laugh&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;cry&nbsp;&nbsp;with&nbsp;&nbsp;you,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’ve&nbsp;&nbsp;half&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;mind&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;die&nbsp;&nbsp;with&nbsp;&nbsp;you,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old&nbsp;&nbsp;year,&nbsp;&nbsp;if&nbsp;&nbsp;you&nbsp;&nbsp;must&nbsp;&nbsp;die.”<br />
</p>
<p>
She stood but a moment, the voice read on, but
she did not care to listen; she went on at a slow
pace, enjoying each step of the way past the barren
fields lying warm and brown in the sunlight,
past the farm-houses, past the low-eaved homestead
of the Harrisons, past the iron gates of the
Old Place with the voice in her ears and the sigh
for the old year in her heart. She almost wished
that she could love Felix Harrison; she had refused
him five times since her seventeenth birthday and
in May she would be twenty-five! He had said
that he would never ask her again. Why should
she wish for any change to come into her life?
If she might always live in the present, she would
be content; she had her father and mother and
Dine and Gus; her world was broad enough.
</p>
<p>
The sound of wheels had been pursuing her;
a sudden stoppage, then another voice that she
knew called to her, “Miss Tessa, will you ride
with me?”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps you are not going my way,” she said
lightly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>
</p>
<p>
“I am going to Dunellen.” He answered her
words only.
</p>
<p>
As soon as they were seated in the carriage, she
said very gravely, “I wrote you a letter last night,
but I burned it this morning.”
</p>
<p>
“I am sorry for that.”
</p>
<p>
The words came out with a gasp and a jerk; she
did not know that words <em>could</em> choke like that, but
she was glad as soon as she had spoken. “Mr.
Towne, are you engaged to Sue Greyson?”
</p>
<p>
“Engaged! And to Sue Greyson!”
</p>
<p>
“I did not ask to be saucy—I did not believe
it—but don’t be heartless—don’t be cruel—don’t be
stupid, do think about her, and don’t let her die of
shame.”
</p>
<p>
“Excuse me, Miss Tessa. Why should you talk
to me about Sue Greyson?”
</p>
<p>
“I knew that you would not understand.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps you can explain.”
</p>
<p>
“I can’t explain; you ought to know.”
</p>
<p>
“What ought I to know?” he queried, looking
down at her with the sunshine in his eyes.
</p>
<p>
“It seems mean in me to tell you such a thing,
but I do not know of any other way for your sake
and hers. I would do any thing to keep you from
doing a heartless thing.”—Another heartless thing,
she almost said.—“I would do any thing for Sue,
as I would for Dine if <em>she</em> had been led into trusting
in a lie.”
</p>
<p>
His face became perplexed, uncomprehending.
</p>
<p>
“Are you trying to tell me that Sue Greyson
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
thinks that I am intending to marry her and that
I have given her an occasion to believe it? You
are warning me against trifling with Sue?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“How do you know that she thinks so?”
</p>
<p>
“Nonsense! How do I know any thing?”
</p>
<p>
“I should as soon have thought—” he ended
with a laugh.
</p>
<p>
“A woman’s heart is not made of grains of sand
to be blown hither and thither by a man’s breath,”
she said very earnestly.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Tessa, you accuse me wrongfully. I have
been kind to Sue—I have intended to be kind.
Her life at home is too quiet for her, she has few
friends and no education; you call me heartless.
I thought that I was most brotherly and thoughtful.”
</p>
<p>
His sincerity almost reassured her. Had she
misjudged him?
</p>
<p>
“I beg your pardon,” she said, after an uncomfortable
pause. “I did not know that Old Place
was a monastery and that you were a monk. If
you are speaking sincerely, you are the most stupid
human being that ever breathed; if you are not
sincere, you are too wily for me to understand.”
</p>
<p>
The color rose to his forehead, but he was silent.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Towne! Excuse me. I am apt to speak
too strongly; but I care so much for Sue. She is
only a child in her experiences; she has no fore-thought,
she trusts every body, and she thinks that
you are so good and wonderful. She does not understand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
any thing but sincerity. Will you think
about her?”
</p>
<p>
“I will.”
</p>
<p>
She was almost frightened, was he angry?
</p>
<p>
“Are you angry with me?” she asked, laying
her hand on his arm. “You can not misinterpret
me; I don’t want Sue to be hurt, and I do not
want you to be capable of hurting her.”
</p>
<p>
“I understand you, Miss Tessa.”
</p>
<p>
He spoke gently; her heart was at rest again.
</p>
<p>
“You say that you can not understand whether
I am wily or sincere?”
</p>
<p>
“I can not understand.”
</p>
<p>
“Neither can I. But I <em>think</em> that I am sincere!”
</p>
<p>
“And please be careful how you change your attitude
towards her; you are unconventional enough
to refuse a woman upon the slightest pretext. I
know that you will say ‘I regret exceedingly, Miss
Sue, that you have misinterpreted my friendly attentions.’”
</p>
<p>
“I would like to; I think many things that I do
not speak, Miss Tessa.”
</p>
<p>
“Your head and heart would echo a perpetual
silence if you did not,” she laughed. “The Sphinx
is a chatterbox compared to you.”
</p>
<p>
As they drove up under the maple-trees before
the low iron gate, he said, “Has this year been a
happy year to you? Do you sleep well?”
</p>
<p>
“Wouldn’t you like to look at my tongue and feel
my pulse?” she returned in her lightest tone.
</p>
<p>
“Will you not answer me?” he asked gravely.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>
</p>
<p>
“This year has been the best year of my life.”
</p>
<p>
“So has it been my best year. This winter I
shall decide several things pertaining to my future;
it is my plan to practice for awhile—and
not marry!”
</p>
<p>
Were those last words for her? Discomfited and
wounded—oh, how wounded!—her lips refused to
speak.
</p>
<p>
“Good-by,” she said, just touching his hand.
</p>
<p>
He turned as he was driving off and lifted his
hat, the sunshine of his eyes fell full upon her; her
smile was but a pitiful effort; what right had he to
say such a thing to her?
</p>
<p>
“I hope,” she said, as she walked up the path,
“that I shall never see you again.”
</p>
<p>
“I wish that I had never seen her,” he ejaculated,
touching his horse with the whip.
</p>
<p>
And thus a part of the old year died and was
buried.
</p>
<p>
Shaking with cold, not daring to go away by herself,
she irresolutely turned the knob of the sitting-room
door; her face, she was aware, was not in a
state to be taken before her mother’s critical eyes;
but her heart was so crushed, she pitied herself
with such infinite compassion, that she longed for
some one to speak to her kindly, to touch her as if
they loved her; any thing to take some of the aching
away from that place in her heart where the
tears were frozen.
</p>
<p>
When she needed any mothering she gave it to
herself; with her arms around her shivering, shrinking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
self, she was beseeching, “Be brave; it’s almost
over.”
</p>
<p>
In the old days, the impulsive little Tessa had
always chided herself; the sensitive little Tessa had
always comforted herself; the truthful, eager, castle-building
little Tessa had always been her own refuge,
shield, adviser, and best comforter.
</p>
<p>
With more bosom friends than she knew how to
have confidences with, with more admiring girl
friends than she could find a place for, with more
hearts open to her than to any one girl at school,
Tessa the child, Tessa the maiden, and Tessa the
woman had always lived within herself, leaned
upon herself.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Hammerton said that she was a confutation
of the oak and vine theory, that he had stood and
stood to be entwined about, but that she would
never entwine.
</p>
<p>
In this moment, standing at the door, with her
hand upon the knob, a ray of comfort shone into
her heart and nestled there like a gleam of sunlight
peering through an opening in an under-growth,
and the ray of comfort was, that, perhaps
Gus Hammerton would come to-night and talk to
her in his kindly, practical, unsentimental fashion,
sympathizing with her unspoken thoughts, and
tender towards the feelings of whose existence he
was unaware.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps—but of late, did she fancy, or was it
true? that he was rather shy with her, and dropped
into the chair nearest to Dinah.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
</p>
<p>
Well! she could be alone by and by and go to
sleep!
</p>
<p>
So relentless was she, in that instant toward
Ralph Towne that it would have been absolute
relief could she have looked into his dead face: to
see the cold lids shut down fast over the sunshiny
eyes, to know that the stiff lips could never open
to speak meaningless words, to touch his head and
feel assured that, warm and soft, his fingers could
never hold hers again.
</p>
<p>
“Why, Tessa, you look frozen to death,” exclaimed
her mother. “How far did you go and
where did you meet Mr. Towne?”
</p>
<p>
“I went to Mayfield,” she closed the door and
moved towards the gay little figure reading “The
Story of Elizabeth” upon the lounge. “Mr. Towne
overtook me after I had passed Old Place.”
</p>
<p>
“O, Tessa,” cried Dinah, dropping her book, “Dr.
Lake was here. What a pity you were out! He
asked where ‘Mystic’ was. I made a list on the
cover of my book of the things that he talked about.
Just hear them. One ought to understand short-hand
to keep up with him. Now listen.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa stood and listened.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘The&nbsp;&nbsp;Valley&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;Dog,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘The&nbsp;&nbsp;Car&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;Juggernaut,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Insanity,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Intemperance,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Tobacco,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Slavery,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Church&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;State,<br />
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Conceit,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Surgery,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘The&nbsp;&nbsp;English&nbsp;&nbsp;Government,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Ladies&nbsp;&nbsp;as&nbsp;&nbsp;Physicians,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘The&nbsp;&nbsp;Wicked&nbsp;&nbsp;World,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘A&nbsp;&nbsp;Quotation&nbsp;&nbsp;from&nbsp;&nbsp;Scott.’<br />
</p>
<p>
“And that isn’t half. I began to grow interested
there, and forgot to write.”
</p>
<p>
“Where did the professional call come in?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, that doesn’t take a second. He watches his
patient while he talks! Oh, and he told two hospital
stories, a story of his school life, and about
being lost in the woods, and about a camp-meeting!
He is from Mississippi. Your Mr. Towne couldn’t
say so much in ten years.”
</p>
<p>
“He says that the disease in my lungs is not
progressive, but that I should protect my health! I
ought to spend every winter in the West Indies or
in the south of Europe! South of Europe, indeed!
On your father’s business! Now if I had married
John Gesner I might have spent my winters in any
part of the civilized world.”
</p>
<p>
“Would you have taken us?” asked Dinah.
</p>
<p>
“The future is veiled from us mercifully.”
</p>
<p>
Dinah laughed. “Mother, you forget about love.”
</p>
<p>
“<em>Love!</em>” exclaimed Mrs. Wadsworth scornfully,
“I should like to know what love is.”
</p>
<p>
“Father knows,” said Dinah. “Have you read
‘Elizabeth,’ Tessa?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“I’d <em>die</em> before I’d act as she did, wouldn’t you?
I’d die before I’d let any body know that I cared
for him more than he cared for me, wouldn’t you?”
</p>
<p>
“It isn’t so easy to die.”
</p>
<p>
“Did Mr. Towne speak of Sue Greyson?” inquired
Mrs. Wadsworth.
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“What did he say?”
</p>
<p>
“Nothing—much?”
</p>
<p>
“He must have said something. Couldn’t you
judge of his feelings towards her?”
</p>
<p>
“I am not a detective.”
</p>
<p>
“H’m,” ejaculated Mrs. Wadsworth, glancing up
at the uneasy lips, “if he can’t talk or sing, he can
say something.”
</p>
<p>
“Possibly.”
</p>
<p>
Standing alone at one of the windows in her
chamber, she watched the sun go down the last
night of the old year.
</p>
<p>
In her young indignation, she had called Ralph
Towne some harsh names; while under the fascination
of his presence, she had thought that she
did not blame him for any thing; but standing
alone with the happy, false old year behind her,
and the new, empty year opening its door into nowhere,
she cried, with a voiceless cry: “You are
not true; you are not sincere; you are shallow and
selfish.”
</p>
<p>
At this moment, watching the same sunset, for
he had an appreciation of pretty things, he was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>
driving homeward almost as nerve-shaken as Tessa
herself; according to his measure, he was regretting
that these two trusting women were suffering because
of his—he did not call it selfishness—he had
been merely thoughtless.
</p>
<p>
Tessa’s heart could kindle and glow and burn itself
out into white ashes before his would feel the
first tremor of heat; she had prided herself upon
being a student of human nature, but this man in
his selfishness, his slowness, his simplicity, had baffled
her.
</p>
<p>
How could she be a student of human nature if
she understood nothing but truth?
</p>
<p>
She was in a bitter mood to-night, not sparing
Ralph Towne as she would not have spared herself.
The crimson and gold faded! the gray shut down
over her world: “How alone I shall be to live in a
year without him!”
</p>
<p>
“O, Tessa! Tessa!” cried Dinah, running up-stairs,
“here’s Gus, and he has brought us something good
and funny I know, for he’s so provokingly cool.”
</p>
<p>
How could she think thoughts about the old year
and the sunset with this practical friend down-stairs
and a mysterious package that must mean books!
She had expected to cry herself to sleep; instead
she read Dickens with Mr. Hammerton until the
new year was upon them.
</p>
<p>
“Gus,” she said severely, with the volumes of
Dickens piled in her arms up to her chin, “if I
become matter-of-fact, practical, and commonplace
there will be no one in the world to thank but you.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
I had a poem at my finger tips about the old year
that would have forever shattered the fame of Tennyson
and Longfellow.”
</p>
<p>
“As we have lost it, we’ll be content with them,”
he said. “Drop your books and let us read them.”
</p>
<p>
Before the dawn she was dreaming and weeping
in her sleep, for a voice was repeating, not the
voice in the school-house, nor the voice that had
read Longfellow, but the voice that had spoken
the cold good-by at the gate:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The&nbsp;&nbsp;leaves&nbsp;&nbsp;are&nbsp;&nbsp;falling,&nbsp;&nbsp;falling,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solemnly&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;slow;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caw!&nbsp;&nbsp;Caw!&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;rooks&nbsp;&nbsp;are&nbsp;&nbsp;calling,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;sound&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;woe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;sound&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;woe!”<br />
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span><a name='ch4' id='ch4'></a>IV.—SOMEBODY NEW.</h2>
<p>
There was the faintest streak of sunshine on the
dying verbenas in her garden; the dead leaves,
twigs, and sprays looked as if some one who did
not care had trampled on them. She was glad
that the plants were in, that there was a warm
place for them somewhere.
</p>
<p>
The school children were jostling against each
other on the planks, on the opposite side of the
street, laughing and shouting. Nellie Bird was
provokingly chanting:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Freddie’s&nbsp;&nbsp;mad,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;am&nbsp;&nbsp;glad,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;know&nbsp;&nbsp;what&nbsp;&nbsp;will&nbsp;&nbsp;please&nbsp;&nbsp;him.”<br />
</p>
<p>
and there were two little girls in red riding hoods,
plaid cloaks, and gay stockings, skipping along
with their hands joined. It was a hard world for
little girls to grow up in. She had run along the
planks from school once, not so very long ago,
swinging her lunch-basket and teasing Felix Harrison
just as at this minute Nellie Bird was teasing
Freddie Stone.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>
</p>
<p>
Her needle was taking exquisite stitches; Dinah
liked white aprons for school wear, and this was
the last of the dainty half-dozen. Her mother’s
voice and step broke in upon her reverie.
</p>
<p>
“Tessa, I wouldn’t have believed it, but six of
my cans of tomatoes have all sizzled up! Not one
was last year, though. Mrs. Bird never has such
good luck with hers as we have with ours.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s too bad. But we have so many that we
sha’n’t miss them.”
</p>
<p>
“That isn’t the question. I remember how my
side ached that day. Bridget was so stupid and
you and Dine had gone up to West Point with
Gus; he always is coming and taking you and
Dine off somewhere! You are not attending to a
word I say.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I am; I am thinking how you took us all
three to look at your cans of tomatoes.”
</p>
<p>
“But you don’t care about the tomatoes. You
never do take an interest in house-work. I would
rather have Sue Greyson’s skin stuffed with straw
than to have you around the house. And <em>she</em> is
going to marry Ralph Towne: she passed with
him this morning; they were in the phaeton with
that pair of little grays! And Sue was driving!
I believe that you have taken cold in some way,
you must see the doctor the next time he comes;
your face is the color of chalk, and your eyes are
as big as saucers with dark rims under them! You
sat here writing altogether too late last night.”
</p>
<p>
“It was only eleven when I went up-stairs.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>
</p>
<p>
“That was just an hour too late. What good
does your writing do you or any body, I’d like to
know.”
</p>
<p>
“It is rather too early in my life to judge.”
</p>
<p>
“Your father spoils you about writing; I suppose
that he thinks you are a feather in <em>his</em> cap; I tell
him that you are none of my bringing up.”
</p>
<p>
“I am not ‘up’ yet, perhaps.”
</p>
<p>
“You may as well drop that work and take a run
into Dunellen; the air will do you good. You had
color enough in the summer. I want a spool of red
silk, two pieces of crimson dress braid, and a spool of
fifty cotton. Don’t get scarlet braid, I want crimson;
and run into the library and get me something
exciting; you might have known better than to
bring me that volume of essays!”
</p>
<p>
She folded the apron and laid it on the pile in the
willow work-basket, wrapped herself in a bright
shawl, covered her braids with a brown velvet hat,
and started for her walk, drawing on her gloves as
she went down the path.
</p>
<p>
Her mother stood at the window watching her.
“She is too deep for me,” she soliloquized; “there is
more in her than I shall ever make out. She is so
full of nonsense that I expect she has refused Ralph
Towne, and what for, I can’t see—there’s no one else
in the way.”
</p>
<p>
In Tessa’s pocket was a long and wide envelope
containing the article that she had sat up last night
to write; the lessons gathered from her old year she
had told in her simple, quaint, forcible style. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>
title was as simple as the article: “Making Mistakes.”
</p>
<p>
“Tessa, you are not brilliant,” Miss Jewett had
once remarked, “but you do go right to the
spot.”
</p>
<p>
The fresh air tinged her cheeks, she breathed
more freely away from her work and her reveries;
there was life and light somewhere, she need not
suffocate in the dark.
</p>
<p>
It was not a long walk into the little city of Dunellen;
fifteen minutes of brisk stepping along the
planks brought her to the corner that turned into
the broad, paved, maple-lined street. As she turned
the corner, a lame child in a calico dress and torn
hood staggered past her bent with the weight of a
heavy basket. She stopped and would have spoken,
but the shy eyes were not encouraging.
</p>
<p>
Two years ago all the world might have knocked
at her gate and she would not have heard.
</p>
<p>
“Will you ride?” She lifted her eyes, with their
color deepening, to find Mr. Towne sitting alone
in his carriage looking down at her.
</p>
<p>
“You are going the wrong way.”
</p>
<p>
“Because I am not going <em>your</em> way?” he asked
somewhat sternly.
</p>
<p>
“I thought that you had gone away,” she said
uncomfortably.
</p>
<p>
“We go on the seventeenth.”
</p>
<p>
“You have not told me where?”
</p>
<p>
“Have I not? You have forgotten. Sue will
stay at home and learn to be sensible.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>
</p>
<p>
“I don’t like you when you speak in that tone.”
</p>
<p>
“Then I will never do it again.”
</p>
<p>
“Good-by,” she said cheerily, passing on.
</p>
<p>
His thoughts ran on—“How bright she is! She
has a sweet heart, if ever a woman had! I wonder
if I <em>am</em> letting slip through my fingers one of the
opportunities that come to a man but once in a lifetime!
A year or two hence will do; she cares too
much to forget me.”
</p>
<p>
Her thoughts ran on-“How <em>can</em> you look so
good and so handsome and not be true!”
</p>
<p>
With a quickened step she crossed the Park. Miss
Jewett’s large fancy store was opposite the Park.
</p>
<p>
Miss Jewett was never too tired or too busy to
live again her young life. Sue Greyson was sure
that she had broken somebody’s heart, else she never
was so eloquent in warning her about Stacey Rheid.
Laura Harrison had decided that she had once lived
in constant dread of having a step-mother. Mary
Sherwood wondered if she had ever been a busybody,
and in that experience had learned to warn
her to keep quiet her busy tongue; and Tessa
Wadsworth knew that she must have learned her
one word of advice: “Wait,” through years that
she would not talk about.
</p>
<p>
Miss Jewett was seldom alone; Tessa was glad
to find the clerks absent and no one bending over
the counter but Sue Greyson.
</p>
<p>
“O, Tessa,” she cried in her loud, laughing voice.
“I haven’t seen you in an age.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Jewett’s greeting was a hand-clasp; among
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>
all her girls (and all the girls in Dunellen were
hers) Tessa Wadsworth was the elected one.
</p>
<p>
“Mrs. Towne has every thing so delicious,” Sue
was rattling on; “such perfumes and such silks and
such jewels. Oh, how Old Place makes my mouth
water! I wish you could go over the place, Tessa;
you were never even through the grounds, were
you? Mr. Ralph takes great pride in keeping it
nice; of course, it is really his. I’d marry any
body to live there and have plenty of money and
do just as I please; not that Mr. Ralph isn’t something
out of the common, though. People say
that he never means any thing by his attentions;
Dr. Lake says—”
</p>
<p>
“I hear that you are going to St. Louis,” interrupted
Miss Jewett.
</p>
<p>
“No, I’m not. And I’m as provoked as I can be
and live! Something has happened; Mr. Ralph is
an uneasy mortal; he never knows what he will
do next, and he has changed his mind about taking
me. My cake is all dough about my winter’s
fun. How I cried the night she told me! The
last night of the year, too, when I ought to have
been full of fun. Mrs. Towne wants me to write
to her, but I’d never dare, unless you would help
me, Tessa, about the spelling and punctuation.
Mr. Ralph would laugh until he died over my
letters.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t write to Stacey now, Miss Jewett. I
wrote him a letter one Sunday from Old Place and
told him that he might as well cease. Mr. Ralph
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>
and I had been walking through the wood and he
asked me if I were engaged to Stacey! I thought
it was about time to stop that.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps if you had been home you wouldn’t
have written that letter. Stacey is a fine fellow.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I had thought of it, but that day I decided!
Stacey can hardly support one, let alone two. Father
says that I was born to have a rich husband
because I have such luxurious tastes! I know that
I shall die cooped up at home. I have to go out
to see the sons and daughters of the land. Tessa,
I don’t see how you live.”
</p>
<p>
“I do, nevertheless,” said Tessa, selecting her
spool of silk.
</p>
<p>
“I shall have Dr. Lake this winter or I couldn’t
exist. He says that he will take me everywhere if
father will only give him the time. He is great fun,
only he does get so moody and serious; sits for two
hours in the office with his head in his hands. Mr.
Ralph doesn’t have moods; he is always pleasant.
I am going to stay these last few days at Old Place.
Tessa, I am coming to stay all night with you and
have a long talk.”
</p>
<p>
“I shall be very glad; I have been wishing that
you would.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’ll come. I have a whole budget to tell
you.”
</p>
<p>
“Sue, you look thin,” said Miss Jewett, rolling
up her purchases.
</p>
<p>
“I <em>am</em> thin. Since the night before New Years
I have lost three pounds.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
</p>
<p>
The night before New Years! Tessa’s veil shaded
her face falling between her and Sue.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Ralph lectured me; oh, <em>how</em> he talked!
When he will, he will, that’s the truth. His
mother says that her will is nothing compared
to his, and I believe it.” Sue’s face grew troubled.
“He told me that I ought to read travels and histories,
and throw away novels; that I ought to
marry Stacey, if he is a good man and can take
care of me—” Her voice sounded as if she were
crying; she laughed instead and ran off.
</p>
<p>
“Something at Old Place has hurt Sue; I didn’t
like the idea of Mrs. Towne taking her up; Mr.
Towne—I do not know about him! Do you?”
</p>
<p>
“No.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah, here comes Sarah! Rachel has a sore throat,
and Mary has gone to the city to buy to-day. Light
the gas, Sarah.”
</p>
<p>
The light flashed over the faces: Miss Jewett’s
almost as fair as a child’s, and sweeter than any
child’s that Tessa had ever seen, with a mouth
in the lines of which her whole history was written,
with just a suspicion of dimples in the tinted
cheeks, with brown rings of soft hair touching
the smooth forehead; the younger face was hurried,
anxious, with a trembling of the lips, and a
nervous gleam in the eyes that were so dark, to-night,
that they might have been mistaken for
hazel.
</p>
<p>
The door was pushed open; a crowd of girls giggled
in; Tessa bowed to Mary Sherwood and moved
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>
aside. She was turning over a pile of wools, selecting
colors for a sacque for Dinah, when a laugh
from the group thrilled her; low, deep, full, in all
her life she had never heard a sound like it.
</p>
<p>
It was as sweet as the note of a thrush and as
jubilant as a thoughtless girl.
</p>
<p>
“Now, Naughty Nan, you are laughing at me.
But I will forgive you, because you are going
away so soon. When are you coming back?”
</p>
<p>
“Never. I will allure the black bear to take me
around the world.”
</p>
<p>
Naughty Nan stepped back, tossing her curls
away from her face; Tessa looked down into her
face, for she was a little thing; it was not a remarkable
face: a broad forehead, deep set brown
eyes, a passable complexion, a saucy mouth. If
she would only laugh again; but she would not
even speak.
</p>
<p>
How surprised Tessa would have been had she
known that Naughty Nan had been studying her
and wishing, “I want to be like you.”
</p>
<p>
The group of girls giggled out.
</p>
<p>
“I have fallen in love,” said Tessa.
</p>
<p>
“With Nan Gerard? Every body does. She is
one of those lovable little creatures that every body
spoils! It’s strange that you haven’t met her; she
is Mary Sherwood’s cousin.”
</p>
<p>
“I do remember now—Mr. Hammerton told me
that I must hear her laugh.”
</p>
<p>
“Her home is in St. Louis; she had never been
in Dunellen until a month since; she was her father’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
pet and lived abroad with him until he died
a year ago! He named her Naughty Nan. She
has plenty of money and plenty of lovers! She
is going home under the escort of Mr. Towne
and his mother. Perhaps it is her laugh that has
stolen his heart from Sue! Naughty Nan was to be
married, but the gentleman died in consumption.”
</p>
<p>
“And she can laugh as lightly as that! If my
father should die I would never laugh again.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span><a name='ch5' id='ch5'></a>V.—HEARTS THAT WERE WAITING.</h2>
<p>
On the evening of the eighteenth of January,
Tessa was sitting alone in her chamber, wrapped
in her shawl, writing. She was keeping a secret,
for she was writing a book and no one knew it but
Mr. Hammerton; he would not have known it had
not several questions arisen to which she could find
no answer.
</p>
<p>
“I can not do without my encyclopedia,” she
had said.
</p>
<p>
She had written the title lovingly—“Under the
Wings.”
</p>
<p>
This chamber was her sanctuary; she was born
in this room, she had lived in it ever since; her little
battles had been fought on this consecrated
ground, her angry tears, her wilful tears, and the
few later grateful tears had fallen while kneeling
at the side of the white-draped bed or sitting at
the window with her head in her hands or on
the window-sill. A stranger would have thought
it a plain, low room with its cottage set of pale
green and gold trimmings, its ingrain carpet of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>
oak leaves on a green ground, its gray paper with
scarlet border, and three white shades with scarlet
tassels.
</p>
<p>
The high mantel was piled with books, the gifts
of her father, Mr. Hammerton, and Miss Jewett; on
the walls were photographs in oval black-walnut
frames of Miss Jewett, sitting at a table with her
elbow upon it and one hand resting on a book in
her lap, of her father and mother, she sitting and
he standing behind her, and one of herself and Dinah,
taken when they were fifteen and twenty-one;
there were also a large photograph taken from a
painting of the Mater Dolorosa, which Mr. Hammerton
had given her on her fourteenth birthday and
a chromo of Red Riding Hood that he had given
to Dinah upon her fourteenth birthday. Upon the
table at which she was writing, books were piled,
and a package of old letters that she had been sorting,
and choosing some to burn, among which were
two from Felix Harrison. The package contained
several from Mr. Hammerton, but his were never
worth burning; they were only worth keeping because
they were so like himself. Pages of manuscript
were scattered among the books, and a long
envelope contained two rejected articles that she
had planned to rewrite after a consultation with
Mr. Hammerton and to send elsewhere. She had
cried over her first rejected article (when she was
eighteen), and two years afterward had revised it,
changed the title, and her father had been proud
of it in print.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>
</p>
<p>
She was writing and thinking of Sue when a
noisy entrance below announced her presence.
</p>
<p>
“Go right up,” said Mrs. Wadsworth’s voice.
“Tessa is star-gazing in her room. Don’t stay if
you are chilly. Tessa likes to be cold.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa met her at the head of the stairs.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve come to stay all night. Do you want
me?”
</p>
<p>
“I want you more than I want any one in the
world.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s refreshing. I wanted to see you and
that’s why I came. Norah Bird said that Dine
was to stay all night with her and I knew I should
have you all to myself. Dr. Lake brought me. I
believe that he wanted me to come. What do you
stay up here for? It’s lovely down-stairs with your
father and mother; she is sewing and he is reading
to her. Put away that great pile of foolscap and
talk to me; I’m as full of talk as an egg is full of
meat.”
</p>
<p>
“Must I break the shell?”
</p>
<p>
“Your room always looks pretty and there isn’t
much in it, either.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course not, after Old Place.”
</p>
<p>
“Old Place <em>is</em> enchanting!” Sue tossed her gloves
and hat to the bed. “I’ll keep on my sacque; I
want to stay up here.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa had reseated herself at the table. Sue
dropped down on the carpet at her feet.
</p>
<p>
“Have they gone?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes! I stayed to see them off and drove
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>
to the depot with them. We called for Nan Gerard.
What a flirt that girl is! Any one would think
that she had known Mr. Ralph all his life.”
</p>
<p>
Sue leaned backward against Tessa; her face was
feverish and excited, her thin cheeks would have
looked hollow but for their high color, her eyes as
she raised them revealed something new; something
new and not altogether pleasant.
</p>
<p>
Tessa touched her hair and then bent over and
kissed her. It was so seldom that Sue was kissed.
</p>
<p>
“You know that night—” Sue began with an
effort, “the night before New Years. Mr. Ralph
found me in his den, I was arranging one of his
tables, and he said that he wanted to talk to me.
And I should think he <em>did</em>! I didn’t know that
he had so much tongue in his head. His mother
calls him Ralph the Silent. Grace Geer calls him
Ralph the Wily when nobody hears. He is Ralph
the Hateful when he wants to be. How he went
on! Fury! There! I promised him not to talk
slang or to use ‘unlady-like exclamations.’ I was
as high and mighty as he was, but I wanted to cry
all the time. He said that I ought to live for something,
that I am not a child but a woman. And I
promised him that I wouldn’t read novels until he
says that I may! He said that I didn’t know what
trouble is! <em>He</em> has had trouble, Grace Geer says.
I don’t see how. Some girl I suppose. Perhaps
she flirted with him. I hope she did. But I have
had trouble. Did <em>he</em> ever wait and wait and wait
for a thing till he almost died with waiting, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
then find that he didn’t get it and never <em>could</em>?
Did you ever feel so?”
</p>
<p>
The appealing eyes were looking into hers; she
could not speak instantly.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t believe that you ever did. You are
quiet. You have a nice home and people to love
you; your mother and father are so proud of you;
your mother is always talking to people about you
as if she couldn’t live without you! And you don’t
have beaux and such horrid things! I shouldn’t
think that you would like Dine to have a lover before
you have one.”
</p>
<p>
“Dine?” said Tessa, looking perplexed.
</p>
<p>
“Why, yes, Mr. Hammerton.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I forgot him,” replied Tessa, almost laughing.
</p>
<p>
“I wish that I had <em>never</em> seen Old Place. I never
should have thought any thing if it hadn’t been
for Grace Geer. Before I went to Old Place I expected
to marry Stacey. She put things into my
head. She used to call me Mrs. Ralph, and tell me
how splendidly I could dress after I was married!
And she used to ask me what he said to me and
explain that it meant something. I didn’t know
that it meant any thing. He was so old and so
wise that I thought he could never think of me.
Once she went home with me and she told father
and Aunt Jane and Dr. Lake that they were going
to lose me. He told me himself that night that he
was more interested in me than in any body.”
</p>
<p>
“Did he say that?” asked Tessa, startled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes, he did.”
</p>
<p>
“So am I interested in your life. I want to see
what becomes of you.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, he didn’t mean <em>that</em>. He meant in me.
But I suppose he didn’t mean any thing, or he
wouldn’t have told his mother not to take me to
St. Louis. You think I like him because he’s rich
and handsome, but I don’t. I like him because he
was so kind to me; nobody was ever so kind to me
before; I can love any one who is kind to me. He
gave me his photograph a year ago. It’s elegant.
I’ll show it to you some time. I know he had six
taken, for I saw them and counted them; he didn’t
know it, though. And I heard him tell his mother
that he had <em>five</em> taken. I never could find out
where that sixth one went to. I know that his
mother had one, and Grace Geer, and Miss Sarepta
Towne, that’s three! And mine was four, and
Philip Towne’s was five. I asked him where the
other was.”
</p>
<p>
“What did he say?” asked Tessa, gravely.
</p>
<p>
“He said nothing. I know that Aunt Jane
thinks my not going the queerest thing in nature,
and father looked rather nonplussed and asked me
what I had been doing. I am as ashamed as I
can be.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa arranged her papers thoughtfully; she was
pondering Grace Geer’s name for Mr. Towne.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps he will change his mind and come
home and like me,” said Sue, brightening.
</p>
<p>
“O, Sue, Sue, don’t make a disappointment for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
yourself! When there are so many good and beautiful
things in the world, why do you see only this
that is being withheld?”
</p>
<p>
“Because—” with a drooping head, “I want it
so.”
</p>
<p>
“There are good men and good women in the
world, Sue; men and women whose word is pure
gold.”
</p>
<p>
“Whose, I’d like to know?”
</p>
<p>
“Miss Jewett’s.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, of course!”
</p>
<p>
“And Gus Hammerton’s.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, he’s as wise and stupid as an owl!”
</p>
<p>
“Dr. Johnson could think in Latin and I should
not wonder if Gus could.”
</p>
<p>
“But he’s awkward and never talks nonsense,
and he wears spectacles and has a tiny bald spot
on the top of his head, the place where the wool
ought to grow! The girls don’t run after him.”
</p>
<p>
“They are not wise enough.”
</p>
<p>
“He’s so old, too.”
</p>
<p>
“He’s younger than Mr. Towne.”
</p>
<p>
“He doesn’t look so. And he’s poor.”
</p>
<p>
“He has a good salary in the bank.”
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Ralph has the pure gold, but it is not in his
word. I only wish it was. I always pray over my
love affairs; they ought to come out all right.”
</p>
<p>
“How do you know what ‘all right’ is?”
</p>
<p>
“I know what I want.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll say to you what Miss Jewett always says
<em>Wait</em>.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
</p>
<p>
“What for? I don’t know what I’m waiting for.
Do you?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“What? Tell me.”
</p>
<p>
“<em>The will of God</em>.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” Sue drew nearer as if she were frightened.
After a while she spoke: “I’m so sorry for
dear Mrs. Towne. She has every thing in the
world but the thing she wants most. She said
one day that she would be willing to be the poorest
woman in Dunellen if she might have a daughter.
She said it one day after we had passed you;
you were alone, picking up leaves near the corner
by the brook. ‘A daughter like that,’ she said,
and she turned to look back at you; you were
standing still with the leaves in your hand. Mr.
Ralph didn’t say anything, but he looked back, too.
I said, ‘That’s Tessa Wadsworth.’ Mrs. Towne
said, ‘Do you know her, Ralph?’ and he said, ‘I
have met her several times.’”
</p>
<p>
Tessa had wiped her gold pen and slipped it into
its morocco case; she closed her writing-desk as she
said cheerily: “Now about this winter, Sue; what
do you intend to do?”
</p>
<p>
“You don’t know how horrid it is at home! Father
always has his pockets full of bottles and he
doesn’t care for the things that interest me; all he
talks about is his ‘cases,’ and all Aunt Jane cares
for is house-work and the murders in the newspapers;
Dr. Lake is splendid, but he’s so poor and he’s
low-spirited when he isn’t full of fun; and when his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>
engagement with father is ended he’ll set up for
himself, and it will take him a century to afford to
be married.”
</p>
<p>
“Sue, look up at me and listen.”
</p>
<p>
Sue looked up and listened.
</p>
<p>
“I pray you don’t flirt with Dr. Lake.”
</p>
<p>
Sue laughed a conscious laugh.
</p>
<p>
“Men flirt; they haven’t any hearts.”
</p>
<p>
“He has. You do not know the influence for
evil that you may become in his life.”
</p>
<p>
Sue’s eyes grew wild, she clung to Tessa with
both hands. “You sha’n’t talk so to me. You
sha’n’t. You make me afraid. I’ll try to be good.
I <em>will</em> try.”
</p>
<p>
“How will you try?”
</p>
<p>
“I won’t try to make him like me. I am sure
that he would if I should try a little. I’ll tell him
about Stacey. Tessa, <em>I don’t want to be an old maid.</em>”
</p>
<p>
Tessa’s eyes and lips kept themselves grave.
</p>
<p>
“I wouldn’t think about that. I’d do good and
be good; I’d help Aunt Jane, and go with your
father on his long drives—”
</p>
<p>
“I’d rather go with Dr. Lake.”
</p>
<p>
“Let your father see what a delightful daughter
you can be. My father and I can talk for hours
about books and places and people.”
</p>
<p>
“Hateful! I hate books. And I don’t know
about places and book-people.”
</p>
<p>
“And don’t wait for Dr. Lake to come in at
night.”
</p>
<p>
“I do. I made him a cup of coffee last night.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>
</p>
<p>
“Who makes coffee for your father?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh father thought that I made it for him. But
Dr. Lake knew!”
</p>
<p>
“I will read history with you this winter. Dine
and I intend to study German with Gus Hammerton;
you can study with us, if you will.”
</p>
<p>
“Ugh!” groaned Sue, “as if that were as much
fun as getting married.”
</p>
<p>
“It may help along. Who knows?” laughed
Tessa.
</p>
<p>
“I’m going to make Miss Gesner a visit next
month. She asked me to-day. But they are such
old men? Mr. John Gesner is an old beau! Mr.
Lewis is lovely, so kind and polite. And Miss Gesner
is charming when she doesn’t try to educate
me. Their house is grander than Old Place and
they keep more servants. I’ll forget all about Old
Place before spring. Mr. John Gesner likes girls.”
</p>
<p>
“Sue.”
</p>
<p>
“Well! Don’t be so solemn.”
</p>
<p>
“If I were to die and leave a little girl in the
world as your mother left you, I would hope that
some one would watch over her, and if the time
came, through her own foolishness, or in the way
of God’s discipline, for a disappointment to come to
her, I would hope that this friend would love her
as I love you to-night. She would warn her, advise
her, and encourage her! Don’t go to visit
Miss Gesner; she is selfish to ask you; you are
bright and lively and she likes to have you to help
entertain her friends—but you will not be so good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>
a daughter to your father if your heart is drawn
away from his home; the best home that he can
afford to give you.”
</p>
<p>
“There’s danger at home and danger abroad,”
laughed Sue. “Don’t you wish that you could put
me in a glass case?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know what to do with you.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, something will happen to me before long.
I’ll get married or die or something. I’m glad I
had my things ready to go with the Townes, for
now I have them ready to go to Miss Gesner’s. I
wish I had a mother and my little brother hadn’t
died. I’d like to have a <em>real</em> home like yours! I
wouldn’t mind if it were as plain as this; but I’d
rather have it like Old Place. Won’t Nan Gerard
have a lovely time? Such a long journey, and
Mr. Ralph will be so attentive, and she’ll be so
proud to be with such a handsome fellow! Don’t
you like to be proud of people that belong to you?
I am always proud enough to go out with Mr.
Ralph.”
</p>
<p>
“There is some one else to be proud of somewhere!
Sue, can’t you be brave?”
</p>
<p>
“Somebody will have what I want,” said Sue.
“I can’t bear to think of that. I shall have to
drive past Old Place in father’s chaise with one
horse, and I hate to drive with one horse! and see
somebody in <em>my</em> place in silks and velvets and diamonds
and emeralds! And <em>she</em> will have visitors
from all over and Old Place will be full of good
times and Mr. Ralph will let her do it all and be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
so kind to her! And she will be so proud and
happy and handsome. Would <em>you</em> like that? You
know you wouldn’t. Do you think that I really
must give him up?”
</p>
<p>
Sue did not see the distressed face above her;
she felt that the fingers that touched her hair and
forehead were loving and pitiful.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t talk so; don’t <em>think</em> so! Forget all about
Old Place. Do you not remember Mrs. Towne’s
kindness? That is a happier thing to think of
than the grounds and the house and handsome
furniture.”
</p>
<p>
“I wish I had told you about it before,” sobbed
Sue. “You would have made it right for me; then
I wouldn’t have thought and thought about it until
it was <em>real</em>. And now I can’t believe that it isn’t
true and the house is shut up with only Mr. and
Mrs. Ryerson and the boy to look after things and
Mr. Ralph gone not to come back—ever, perhaps.
If Mrs. Towne should die, perhaps he won’t come
back but go off and be a doctor; for he doesn’t
want to be married, he said so; he told his mother
so. I don’t want him to be a doctor and have bottles
in all his pockets and smell of medicine like
father and Dr. Lake. He wouldn’t be Mr. Ralph
any more.”
</p>
<p>
“So much the better for you.”
</p>
<p>
“Then you don’t think that he’s so grand.”
</p>
<p>
She answered quietly, surprising herself with the
truth that she had not dared to confess to herself,
“No. I do not think he is so grand.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
</p>
<p>
“Who is?”
</p>
<p>
“Who is? George Macdonald and George Eliot
and Shakespeare and St. Paul and my father and
your father,” laughed Tessa.
</p>
<p>
“Hark. They are singing over the way.”
</p>
<p>
“There’s a child’s party there to-night.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa went to the window.
</p>
<p>
Loud and merry were the voices:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Little&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally&nbsp;&nbsp;Waters&nbsp;&nbsp;sitting&nbsp;&nbsp;in&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;sun,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weeping&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;crying&nbsp;&nbsp;for&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;man.”<br />
</p>
<p>
Sue laughed. “Oh, how that carries me back.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s good advice,” said Tessa, as the children
shouted—
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Rise,&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally,&nbsp;&nbsp;rise,&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;wipe&nbsp;&nbsp;off&nbsp;&nbsp;your&nbsp;&nbsp;eyes.”<br />
</p>
<p>
“I wish that I were a little girl over there in
the fun,” said Sue. “Suppose we go.”
</p>
<p>
“I intended to go. Perhaps we can teach them
some new games.”
</p>
<p>
No one among the children was merrier than
Sue; not one any more a child.
</p>
<p>
“I think I’ll stay little,” said Sue, coming to
Tessa, half out of breath. “I’m never going to
grow up; it’s hateful being a woman, isn’t it?”
</p>
<p>
“You will never know,” said Tessa laughing.
“There’s little Harry Sherwood calling for Sue
Greyson now.”
</p>
<p>
Towards midnight, when Tessa was asleep, Sue
awakened her with, “Put your arm around me, I
can’t go to sleep.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>
</p>
<p>
Sue lay still not speaking or moving.
</p>
<p>
The clock in the sitting-room struck three.
</p>
<p>
“Tessa, Tessa,” whispered a startled voice, “are
you awake?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” rousing herself, “what is it? Is any
thing the matter?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no,” wearily, “but it has struck one, and
two, and three, and I’m afraid it will strike four.”
</p>
<p>
“I suppose it will unless the clock stops or time
ceases to be.”
</p>
<p>
“What will be when time ceases to be? What
comes next?”
</p>
<p>
“Forever comes next. Don’t you want it to be
forever?”
</p>
<p>
“You sha’n’t talk so and frighten me. I can’t go
to sleep. I thought somebody was dying or dead.”
</p>
<p>
“You were dreaming.” Tessa put a loving arm
around her. “Didn’t you ever say the multiplication
table in the night?”
</p>
<p>
“No, nor any other time.”
</p>
<p>
The moonlight shone in through the open window,
making a golden track across the carpet.
</p>
<p>
“The moon shines on Red Riding Hood,” said
Sue. “Tell me a story, Tessa.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you like the moonlight? Some one had
a lovely little room once and she said that the
moonlight came in and swept it clean of foolish
thoughts.”
</p>
<p>
“What else?” in an interested voice.
</p>
<p>
“It is a long story; it is in blank verse, too, and
you like rhymes.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
</p>
<p>
“I’ve been trying to say Mother Goose and Old
Mother Hubbard.”
</p>
<p>
“I will tell you a story,” said Tessa, as wide
awake as if the sun were shining. “I will rhyme
it as I run along, and when I hesitate and can not
make good sense and a perfect rhyme, we’ll go to
sleep.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, but you must do your best.”
</p>
<p>
“I always do my best. I tell Gus and Dine
stories in rhyme.”
</p>
<p>
So she began with a description of a little girl
who was fair and a boy who was brave, who grew
up and grew together, but cruel fate in the shape
of a step-mother separated them, and he travelled
all over the world, and she stayed at home and
made tatting, until a hundred years went by and
he came to the door a worn-out traveller and found
her a withered maiden sitting alone feeding her
cat. Afterward in trying to recall this, she only
remembered one couplet:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“He&nbsp;&nbsp;was&nbsp;&nbsp;covered&nbsp;&nbsp;with&nbsp;&nbsp;snow,&nbsp;&nbsp;his&nbsp;&nbsp;hat&nbsp;&nbsp;with&nbsp;&nbsp;fur,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&nbsp;&nbsp;took&nbsp;&nbsp;it&nbsp;&nbsp;off&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;bowed&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;her.”<br />
</p>
<p>
Once or twice Sue gave a hysterical laugh.
</p>
<p>
The story was brought to a proper and blissful
conclusion; still Sue was sleepless.
</p>
<p>
“How far on their journey do you suppose they
are now?”
</p>
<p>
“I’m not a time-table.”
</p>
<p>
Sue lay too still to be asleep; when she <em>was</em> still
she was a marvel of stillness.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
</p>
<p>
Daylight and breakfast found her in high spirits,
asking advice of Mrs. Wadsworth about making a
wrapper out of an old brown cashmere, and talking
to Tessa about the drive that she had promised to
take with Dr. Lake, saying the last thing as she
ran down the steps, “I’ll come and study German
if I can’t find any thing better to do.”
</p>
<p>
In all the talks afterward, Sue never alluded to
this night; it was the only part of her life that she
wished Tessa to forget; she herself forgot every
thing except that she was miserable about Mr.
Ralph and two of the lines in the story that she
had laughed about and called as “stupid” as her
own life:
</p>
<p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span><a name='ch6' id='ch6'></a>VI.—ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY.</h2>
<p>
“Miss Jewett.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, dear.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa was sitting on the carpet in Miss Jewett’s
little parlor with her head in Miss Jewett’s lap;
Miss Jewett had been smoothing the girl’s hair for
several minutes, neither speaking.
</p>
<p>
“I have lost something; I don’t dare try to find
it for fear that God has taken it away from me.”
</p>
<p>
“How did you lose it?”
</p>
<p>
Tessa raised her head, paused, then spoke impressively:
“I lost it through <em>carefulness</em>.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah! I have heard of such a thing before.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, have you? Is any one in the world like
me? I thought that no one ever made such mistakes
as I do, or needed the discipline that I need!”
</p>
<p>
“My dear, all hearts are fashioned alike.”
</p>
<p>
“But all lives are not alike.”
</p>
<p>
“Not so different as you imagine; in my girls I
live over my old struggles, longings, mistakes; in
the history of lives lived ages ago I find the same
struggles, longings, mistakes, the same need of the
same discipline.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, if you can help me; if you can only help
me! You study the Bible, isn’t every thing in the
Bible? Didn’t Paul mean that every thing was in
it when he said that through the comfort of the
Scriptures we have hope? I can not find any
thing to suit me; <em>you</em> find something.”
</p>
<p>
The gaslight was more than she could bear, she
dropped her head again, covering her face with
both hands.
</p>
<p>
“Suppose you tell me all about it.”
</p>
<p>
“<em>All about it</em>,” repeated Tessa in a muffled tone.
“I could not if I wanted to; but I can tell you
where the despair comes in.”
</p>
<p>
“That is all I want to know.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” raising her head again and speaking
clearly and slowly. “It was an opportunity to get
something that I wanted. I thought I had it, I
thought it was laid in my hand and I had but to
clasp my fingers tightly over it to keep it forever
and forever; I cared so much that I hardly cared for
any thing else. I do not think that I would lose it
again through caring too much. Do you think that
it is just as hard for God to see us too careful as too
careless?”
</p>
<p>
“How were you too careful?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, in being wise and doing things in my own
way. What I want to know is this: did He ever
give any body another opportunity? If He ever
did, I will hope that He will be just as tender
towards me.”
</p>
<p>
“Christ came down to earth to seek the lost; a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
lost opportunity is one of the things that He came
to find. I think if you seek it for His sake, and
not for your own, that He will find it for you.”
</p>
<p>
“For His sake, not for mine,” repeated Tessa,
wonderingly. “How can I ever attain to that? I
am very selfish.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you remember about David, whose heart
was fashioned like yours, how careful he was once
and what happened?”
</p>
<p>
Miss Jewett was speaking in her brisk, working
voice; the troubled face had become alight.
</p>
<p>
“Now we will read about one who made a sorry
mistake by being so careful that he forgot to find
out God’s way of doing a certain thing. He did
the thing that he wanted to do after a style of his
own.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa arose and went into Miss Jewett’s bedroom;
she knew that the Bible she loved best, the
one pencilled and interlined, was always kept on a
stand near the head of her bed. While Miss Jewett
was opening it, Tessa said hurriedly and earnestly
“I knew that if it were anywhere in the Bible—that
if any one in the world had suffered like me—that
you would know where to find them. You
said last Sunday that God had written something
to help us in every perplexity; but I studied and
studied and could not find any thing about second
opportunities. Perhaps mine is only a foolish little
trouble; not a grand one like David’s.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you think that God likes to hear you say
that?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
</p>
<p>
“No,” confessed Tessa. “I will not even think
it again.”
</p>
<p>
“Have you forgotten how David attempted to
bring the Ark into the city of David, and how he
failed? What a mortifying and distressing failure
it was, too. Now I’ll read it to you.”
</p>
<p>
One of Tessa’s pleasures was to listen to her reading
the Bible; she read as if David lived across the
Park, and as if the city of David were not a mile
away.
</p>
<p>
Tessa kept her head in its old position and listened
with intent and longing eyes.
</p>
<p>
“‘And David consulted with the captains of
thousands and hundreds and every leader. And
David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If
it seem good unto you, and that it be of the Lord
our God, let us send abroad unto our brethren
everywhere, that are left in all the land of Israel,
and with them also to the priests and Levites
which are in their cities and suburbs, that they
may gather themselves together unto us: and let
us bring again the Ark of our God to us: for we
inquired not at it in the days of Saul. And all the
congregation said that they would do so: for the
thing was right in the eyes of all the people. So
David gathered all Israel together from Shihor of
Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring
the Ark of God from Kirjath-jearim. And David
went up and all Israel to Baalah, that is to Kirjath-jearim,
which belonged to Judah, to bring up
thence the Ark of God the Lord, that dwelleth between
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>
the cherubim whose name is called on it.
And they carried the Ark of God in a new cart—’ In
a <em>new</em> cart, Tessa; see how careful he was!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“‘—Out of the house of Abinadab; and Uzza
and Ahir drave the cart.’ That was all right and
proper, wasn’t it?”
</p>
<p>
“It seems so to me.”
</p>
<p>
“‘And David and all Israel played before God
with all their might, and with singing, and with
harps, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and
with trumpets.’ They were joyful with all their
might. Were you as joyful as that?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes: fully as joyful as that.”
</p>
<p>
“Now see the confusion, the shame, and the fear
that followed those harps and timbrels and trumpets.
‘And when they came unto the threshing-floor
of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold
the Ark; for the oxen stumbled. And the anger
of the Lord was kindled against Uzza, and He
smote him, because he put his hand to the Ark:
and he died before God. And David was displeased,
because the Lord had made a breach upon
Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perez-uzza, to
this day. And David was afraid of God that day,
saying, How shall I bring the Ark of God home
to me?’”
</p>
<p>
“I should think that he <em>would</em> have been afraid,”
said Tessa; “and after he had been so sure and joyful,
too.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Jewett read on: “‘So David brought not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
the Ark home to himself to the city of David, but
carried it aside to the house of Obed-edom the
Gittite.’”
</p>
<p>
Tessa raised her head to speak. “I can not
understand where his mistake was; how could he
have been too careful of such a treasure. Oh, how
terrible and humiliating his disappointment must
have been! How ashamed he was before all the
people! I can bear any thing better than to be
humiliated.”
</p>
<p>
“My poor, proud Tessa.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa’s tears started at the tone; these first words
of sympathy overcame her utterly; she dropped her
head again and cried like a child, like the little
child Tessa who had had so many fits of crying.
</p>
<p>
The eyes above her were as wet as her own;
once or twice warm lips touched her forehead and
cheek.
</p>
<p>
“Did <em>he</em> have another opportunity?” asked Tessa,
at last. “I can understand how afraid he was. I
was troubled because I gave thanks for the thing
that was taken away from me. Did he find an
answer to his ‘How’?”
</p>
<p>
“He was thankful, sincere, and careful.”
</p>
<p>
“I should think that was enough,” exclaimed
Tessa, almost indignantly; “but I know that there
was sin somewhere, else the anger of the Lord
would not have been kindled. They went home
without the Ark. That is saddest of all.”
</p>
<p>
“It was kept three months in the house of Obed-edom,
and during those three months humbled David studied
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
the law and found that his cart, new as
it was, was not according to the will of God.
</p>
<p>
“‘Then David said, None ought to carry the Ark
of God but the Levites; for them hath the Lord
chosen to carry the Ark of God, and to minister
unto Him forever.’”
</p>
<p>
“And he <em>could</em> have known that before,” cried
Tessa.
</p>
<p>
“‘And David gathered all Israel together to
Jerusalem, to bring up the Ark of the Lord unto
his place, which he had prepared for it, and David
assembled the children of Aaron and the Levites and
said unto them, Ye are the
chief of the fathers of the Levites: sanctify yourselves,
both ye and your brethren, that ye may
bring up the Ark of the Lord God of Israel unto
the place that I have prepared for it. For because
ye did it not at the first, the Lord our God made
a breach upon us, for that we sought Him not
after the due order.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, how can we know every thing to do at the
first?”
</p>
<p>
“How could David have known? Now he had
found the right way to do the right thing. ‘So
the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves
to bring up the Ark of the Lord God of Israel. And
the children of the Levites bare the Ark of God
upon their shoulders with the staves thereon as
Moses commanded, according to the word of the
Lord. And David spake to the chief of the Levites
to appoint their brethren to be the singers with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
instruments of music, psalteries and harps and
cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with
joy. So David, and the elders of Israel, and the
captains over thousands, went to bring up the Ark
of the covenant of the Lord out of the house of
Obed-edom with joy.’”
</p>
<p>
“He was not afraid now,” said Tessa. “I think
that he was all the more joyful because he had
been so humiliated and afraid. I will think about
that new cart.”
</p>
<p>
“And those three months in which he was finding
out the will of God. ‘And it came to pass,
when God helped the Levites that bare the Ark of
the covenant of the Lord that they offered seven
bullocks and seven rams.’ He could not help them
the first time because their way was not according
to His law; their joy, their thankfulness, their sincerity,
their carefulness availed them nothing because
they kept not His law. Uzza was a priest
and should have known the law; David was king
and he should have known the law.”
</p>
<p>
“But he had his second opportunity, despite his
mistake.”
</p>
<p>
“And so, if your desire be according to His will
may you have yours; it may be months or years,
half your lifetime, but if you study His word and
ask for your second opportunity through the intercession
of Christ, I am sure that you will
have it.”
</p>
<p>
“Sometimes I am angry, sometimes bewildered,
sometimes there is hatred in my heart because I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>
have been deceived and humiliated—sometimes I
do not want it back—”
</p>
<p>
“My dear,” said Miss Jewett, gravely, “discipline
is better than our heart’s desire.”
</p>
<p>
“Is it? I don’t like to think so.”
</p>
<p>
When the clock in the church-tower struck midnight
Tessa lay awake wondering if she could ever
choose discipline before any heart’s desire.
</p>
<p>
Then she crept closer to Miss Jewett and kissed
her.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span><a name='ch7' id='ch7'></a>VII.—THE LONG DAY.</h2>
<p>
With the apple blossoms came Tessa’s birthday.
She had lived twenty-five years up-stairs and down-stairs
in that white house with the lilac shrubbery
and low iron fence. Twenty-five years with her
father and mother, nineteen with her little sister,
and almost as many with her old friend, Mr. Hammerton;
twenty years with Laura and Felix and
Miss Jewett, and not quite three years with the
latest friend, the latest and the one that she had
most believed in, Ralph Towne.
</p>
<p>
She was counting these years and these friends
as she brushed out her long, light hair and looked
into the reflection of the fair, bright, thoughtful
face that had come to another birthday.
</p>
<p>
Nothing would ever happen to her again, she
was sure; nothing ever did happen after one were
as old as twenty-five. In novels, all the wonderful
events occurred in earlier life, and then—a blank
or bliss or misery, any thing that the reader might
guess.
</p>
<p>
Would her life henceforth be a blank because
she was so old and was growing older?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
</p>
<p>
In one of her stories, Miss Mulock had stated
that the experience of love had been given to
her heroine “later than to most” and <em>she</em> was
twenty-four!
</p>
<p>
“Not that that experience is all one’s life,” she
mused; “but it is just as much to me as it is to
any man or woman that ever lived; as much as to
Cornelia, the matron with her jewels, or Vittoria
Colonna, or Mrs. Browning, or Hypatia,—if she ever
loved any body,—or Miss Jewett,—if she ever did,—or
Sue Greyson, or Queen Victoria, or Ralph Towne’s
mother! I wonder if his father were like him, so
handsome and gentle. I have a right to the pain
and the blessedness of loving; perhaps I <em>have</em> been
in love—perhaps I am now! He shut the door
that he had opened and he has gone out; I would
not recall him if I could do it with one breath—
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘No&nbsp;&nbsp;harm&nbsp;&nbsp;from&nbsp;&nbsp;him&nbsp;&nbsp;can&nbsp;&nbsp;come&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On&nbsp;&nbsp;ocean&nbsp;&nbsp;or&nbsp;&nbsp;on&nbsp;&nbsp;shore.’<br />
</p>
<p>
“Well,” smiling into the sympathetic eyes, “if
nothing new ever happen to me, I’ll find out all the
blessedness of the old.”
</p>
<p>
For she must always find something to be glad
of before she could be sorrowful about any thing.
</p>
<p>
She ran down-stairs in her airiest mood to be
congratulated by her father in a humorous speech
that ended with an unfinished sentence and a
quick turning of the head, to be squeezed and
hugged and kissed by Dinah, and dubbed Miss
Twenty-Five, and then to have her mood changed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
all in the past made dreary, and all in the future
desolate, by one of her mother’s harangues.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Wadsworth had kissed his three girls and
hurried off to his business, as he had done in all the
years that Tessa could remember; Dinah had pushed
her plate away and was leaning forward with her
elbows on the table-cloth, her face alight with the
mischief of teasing Tessa about being “stricken in
years.” Tessa’s repartees were sending Dinah off
into her little shouts of laughter when their mother’s
voice broke in:
</p>
<p>
“I had been married eight years when I was
your age, Tessa.”
</p>
<p>
“It will be nine years on my next birthday,” said
Tessa.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, just nine; for I was married on my seventeenth
birthday; your father met me one day coming
from school and said that he would call that
evening; I curled my hair over and put on my garnet
merino and waited for him an hour. I expected
John Gesner, too. But your father came first and
we set the wedding-day that night. I was seventeen
and he was thirty-seven!”
</p>
<p>
“I congratulate you,” said Tessa. “I congratulate
the woman who married my father.”
</p>
<p>
“Girls are so different,” sighed Mrs. Wadsworth.
“Now <em>I</em> had two offers that year! Aunt Theresa
wanted me to take John Gesner because he was
two years younger than your father; but John
was only a clerk in the Iron Works then, and so
was Lewis. Lewis is just my age. How could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
I tell that he would make a fortune buying
nails?”
</p>
<p>
“You would have hit the nail on the head if you
had known it,” laughed Dinah.
</p>
<p>
“And here’s Dine, now, <em>she</em> is like me. You
are a Wadsworth through and through! Young
men like some life about a girl; how many beaux
Sue Greyson has! All you think of is education!
There was Cliff Manning, you turned the cold
shoulder to him because he couldn’t talk grammar.
What’s grammar? Grammar won’t make the pot
boil.”
</p>
<p>
“Enough of them would,” suggested Dinah.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Towne came and came till he was tired, I
suppose. I hope you didn’t refuse him.”
</p>
<p>
“No, he refused me.”
</p>
<p>
Her tone was so gravely in earnest that her
mother was staggered. Dinah shouted.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Wadsworth went on in a voice that was
gathering indignation: “You may laugh now; you
will not always laugh. ‘He that will not when he
may, when he will he shall have nay.’ Mrs. Sherwood
told me yesterday that she hoped to have
Nan Gerard back here for good, and Mary looked
as if it were all settled. Mr. Towne did not do
much <em>last</em> winter, Mary said, beside run around
with Naughty Nan. I’m hearing all the time of
somebody being married or engaged, and you are
doing nothing but shilly-shally over some book or
trotting around after poor folks with Miss Jewett.”
</p>
<p>
“She will find a prince in a hovel some day,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>
said Dinah. “He will be struck with her attitude as
she is choking some bed-ridden woman with beef-tea
and fall down on his knees and propose on the
spot. ‘Feed me, seraph,’ he will cry.”
</p>
<p>
“He wouldn’t talk grammar, or he couldn’t spell
or read Greek, and she will turn away,” laughed
Mrs. Wadsworth. “Tessa, you are none of my
bringing up.”
</p>
<p>
“That is true,” replied Tessa, the sorrowfulness
of the tone softening its curtness.
</p>
<p>
“You always <em>did</em> care for something in a book
more than for what I said! You never do any
thing to please people; and yet, somehow, somebody
always <em>is</em> running after you. I wish that
you <em>could</em> go out into the world and get a little
character; you are no more capable of self-denial
and heroism than an infant baby; for getting along
in the world and making a good match, I would
rather have Sue Greyson’s skin—”
</p>
<p>
“Her father understands anatomy, perhaps you
can get it, mother.”
</p>
<p>
“<em>She</em> knows how to look out for number one.
Her children will be settled in life before Tessa is
engaged. You needn’t laugh, Dine, it’s her birthday,
and I’m only doing a mother’s duty to her.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa’s eyes laughed although her lips were still.
Her sense of humor helped her to bear many things
in her life.
</p>
<p>
“You have never had a trial in your life, Tessa,
and here you are old enough to be a wife and
mother!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>
</p>
<p>
“If she lived in China she could be a grandmother,”
said Dinah.
</p>
<p>
“I have always kept trouble from you; that is
why, at your mature age, you have so little character.
In an emergency you would have no more
responsibility than Nellie Bird. If you had studied
arithmetic instead of always writing poetry and
compositions, you might have been teaching now
and have been independent.”
</p>
<p>
“Father isn’t tired of taking care of her,” said
Dinah, spiritedly. “It’s mean for you to say that.”
</p>
<p>
“Why don’t you write a novel and make some
money?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know how.”
</p>
<p>
“Can’t you learn?”
</p>
<p>
“I study all the time.”
</p>
<p>
“Why don’t you write flowery language?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know how.”
</p>
<p>
“It is Gus that has spoiled you; he has nipped
your genius in the bud. What does he know, a
clerk in a bank? I know that he tells you to leave
out the long words; and it is the long words that
take. I shouldn’t have had my dreadful cough
winter after winter if I hadn’t worked hard to
spare your time that winter you wrote those three
little books for the Sunday School Union; I lay all
my sickness and pain to that winter.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs Wadsworth had brought this charge against
Tessa several times before, but she had never shivered
over it as she did this birthday morning.
</p>
<p>
“And what did you get for them? Only a hundred
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
dollars for the three. Your father made a
great fuss over them, and he really cried (his tears
come very easy) over that piece you called ‘Making
Mistakes.’ I couldn’t see any thing to cry over;
I thought you made out that making mistakes was
a very fine thing.”
</p>
<p>
“Four people from away off have written to
thank her, any way,” exulted Dinah.
</p>
<p>
“People like your father I suppose.”
</p>
<p>
Dinah sprang up and began to rattle the cups
and saucers; she could not bear the look in Tessa’s
eyes another second.
</p>
<p>
“Dinah, I can’t talk if you make so much noise.
You are very rude.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I forgot to tell you,” cried Dinah, standing
still with two cups in her hands. “It’s great fun!
Nan Gerard refused Mr. John Gesner while she
was here.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t believe it,” exclaimed Mrs Wadsworth.
“Those brothers are worth nearly a million.”
</p>
<p>
“Naughty Nan didn’t care.”
</p>
<p>
“She’ll jump out of the frying-pan into the fire,
then; for the Townes, mother and son, are not
worth a quarter of it.”
</p>
<p>
“What does she care? Mr. Lewis Gesner is a
gentleman, and he knows something.”
</p>
<p>
“He said once that I was only a little doll,”
said Mrs. Wadsworth. “I never liked him afterward.”
</p>
<p>
“I like him,” said Dinah; “he doesn’t flirt with
the girls; he always talks to the old ladies.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>
</p>
<p>
“What are you going to do to-day, Tessa?” inquired
Mrs. Wadsworth, ignoring Dinah’s remark.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I don’t know,” she answered, “and don’t
care” was the unspoken addition.
</p>
<p>
There was one thing she was sure to do. On
her way to the ten o’clock mail she would take a
moment with Miss Jewett for a word, a look; for
something to set her heart to beating to a cheerier
tune. Ten minutes before mail time she found
Miss Jewett as busy as a bee.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Tessa,” glancing up from her desk, “I knew
you would come. I had a good crying spell on
my twenty-fifth birthday and I’ve looked through
clear eyes ever since. I wish for you that your
second quarter may be as full of hard work as
mine.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa felt as if the sun were shining warm again.
At the office she received her birthday present; the
one thing that she most wished for; if ever birthday
face were in a glow and birthday heart set to
dancing, hers were when her fingers held the check
for one hundred and sixty-eight dollars and fifty
cents, and when her eyes ran through the brief,
friendly letter, with its two lines of praise.
</p>
<p>
“I am taken with your book. It gives me a
humbling-down feeling. I hardly know why.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, it’s too good! it’s too good,” she cried, with
her head close to Miss Jewett’s at the desk over the
large day-book. “I was feeling as if nobody cared,
and now he wants another book. As good as this,
he says.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>
</p>
<p>
Tessa lived in fairy-land for the next two hours.
No, she lived in Dunellen on a happy birthday.
</p>
<p>
“Well! well! well!” exclaimed her father, taking
off his spectacles to wipe his eyes, “this is
what I call fine. So this is what you grew pale
over last winter,” he added, looking down into a
face as rosy and wide awake as a child’s waking
out of sleep.
</p>
<p>
“What shall you do with so much money?”
</p>
<p>
“Spend it, of course. I have spent it already a
hundred times.”
</p>
<p>
“You must return receipt and reply to the letter.”
</p>
<p>
“I had forgotten that.”
</p>
<p>
“You will find every thing on my desk. Write
your name on the back of the check and I will
give you the money.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t want to do that. I want to take it into
the bank and surprise Gus with it. His face will
be worth another check.”
</p>
<p>
She wrote her name upon the check, her father
standing beside her. Theresa L. Wadsworth. He
was very proud of this name among his three
girls.
</p>
<p>
“And you expect to do this thing again?”
</p>
<p>
“I do. Many times. All I want is a nook and
a lead pencil.”
</p>
<p>
“Daughter, I would like something else better.”
</p>
<p>
“I wouldn’t. Nothing else. I shall not change
my mind even for a knight in helmet and helmet
feather.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Hammerton’s face <em>was</em> worth another check;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>
he looked down at her from his high stool in a
grave, paternal fashion. She remained decorously
silent.
</p>
<p>
“How women <em>do</em> like to spend money,” he
said. “At six o’clock you will not have a penny
left.”
</p>
<p>
“How can I? Father is to have a farm in Mayfield,
mother is to go to Europe, and Dine is to have
diamond ear-rings!”
</p>
<p>
“And I?”
</p>
<p>
“I will buy you a month to go fishing! And
myself brains enough to write a better book. Isn’t
it comical for me to get more for my book than
Milton got for Paradise Lost?”
</p>
<p>
Tessa laughed as she counted her money at tea-time;
there was a twenty dollar bill and seventy-five
cents! But in her mother’s chamber stood a
suite of black-walnut with marble tops, in one of
Dine’s drawers, materials for a black and white
striped silk, on the sitting-room table a copy of
Shakespeare in three Turkey morocco volumes, for
her father; she had also sent a gold thimble to Sue
Greyson, several volumes of Ruskin to Mr. Hammerton,
Barnes on <em>Job</em> to Miss Jewett, and had purchased
a ream of foolscap, a pint of ink, a pair of
gloves, and <em>The Scarlet Letter</em> for herself!
</p>
<p>
“Is there any thing left in the world that you
want?” her father asked.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, but twenty dollars will not buy it,” she
replied, thinking of Dr. Lake’s anxious face as she
had seen it that day.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>
</p>
<p>
At night, alone in the darkness, there were a few
tears that no one would ever know about. Her joy
in her accepted work was nothing to Ralph Towne.
He did not know about her book and if he knew—would
he care?
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span><a name='ch8' id='ch8'></a>VIII.—A NOTE OUT OF TUNE.</h2>
<p>
The blossom storm came and blew away the apple
blossoms, the heavy fragrance of the lilacs died,
and the shrubbery became again only a mass of
green leaves and ugly, crooked stems; but amid
this, something happened to Tessa; something that
was worth as much to her as any happenings that
came before it; something that had its beginning
when she was a little school-girl running along the
planks and teasing Felix Harrison. How much certain
jarring words spoken that day and how much
a certain bit of news influenced this happening,
she, in her rigid self-analysis, could not determine!
</p>
<p>
She arose from the breakfast table at the same
instant with her father, saying: “Father, I will
walk to the corner with you.”
</p>
<p>
“We were two souls with one thought,” he replied.
“I intended to ask you for a few minutes.”
</p>
<p>
They crossed the street to the planks. She
slipped her arm through his, and as he took the
fingers on his arm with a warm grasp, she said; “I
never want any lover but you, my dear old father.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
</p>
<p>
“Nonsense, child! Only girls who have had a
heart-break say such things to their old fathers,
and your heart is as good as new, I am sure.
Tessa, I want to see you married before I die.”
</p>
<p>
“May you live till you see me married,” she
answered merrily. “What an old mummy you
will be!”
</p>
<p>
“I have been thinking of something that I want
to say to you. I am an old man and I am not
young for my age—”
</p>
<p>
“Now, father.”
</p>
<p>
“I may live a hundred years, of course, and
grow heartier each year, and like the ‘frisky old
girl,’ die at the age of one hundred and ten, and
‘die by a fall from a cherry-tree then,’ but, still
there’s a chance that I may not. And now, Daughter
Tessa”—his voice became as grave as her eyes,
“I want you to promise me that you will always
take care of your poor little mother; poor little
mother! You are never sharp to her like saucy
Dine, and she rests in you like an acorn in an acorn
cup, although she would be the last to confess it.”
</p>
<p>
“I promise to do my best,” Tessa said very
earnestly.
</p>
<p>
“But that is only a part of it. Promise me that
if she wishes to marry again, and her choice be one
that <em>you</em> approve—”
</p>
<p>
“Approve!”
</p>
<p>
“Approve,” he repeated, “that you will not hinder
but rather further it, and keep Dine from making
her unhappy about it.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>
</p>
<p>
“I will not promise. You shall not die,” she
cried passionately. “How can you talk so and
break my heart?”
</p>
<p>
“Dr. Watts says that we all begin to die as soon
as we are born, so I have had to do it pretty thoroughly;
but he was a theologian and not a medical
man. Have you promised?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir,” speaking very quietly, “I have promised.”
</p>
<p>
With her hand upon his arm, they kept even
step for ten silent minutes.
</p>
<p>
“Are you writing again?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Then you must walk every day.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I do, rain or shine. I am going down the
road this afternoon to look at the wheat fields and
the oat fields and to see the boys and girls dropping
corn!”
</p>
<p>
“And to wish that you were a little girl dropping
corn?”
</p>
<p>
“No, indeed,” she said earnestly and solemnly.
“I like my own life better than any life I ever knew
in a book or out of a book.”
</p>
<p>
“When I count up my mercies I’ll remember
that.”
</p>
<p>
She was dwelling upon those words of her father
late that afternoon as she sauntered homeward with
her hands full of wild flowers and grasses.
</p>
<p>
“Mystic, will you ride with me?”
</p>
<p>
A feeling of warmth and of tenderness ever crept
into her heart at the sound of this voice.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
</p>
<p>
She loved Dr. Lake.
</p>
<p>
“No, sir, thank you; I am out for a walk and
when I walk I never ride.”
</p>
<p>
“But I want to talk to you—to tell you something.”
She stepped nearer and stood at the carriage
wheel; his voice was sharp and his white
temples hollow. “Sue has refused me,” he began
with a laugh. “I proposed last night, and what do
you think she said? ‘Why, Dr. Lake, you are poor,
and you smell of medicine.’”
</p>
<p>
“They are both true,” she said, not conscious of
what reply she was making.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” he answered bitterly, “they are both true
and will <em>be</em> true until the end of time. Don’t you
think that you could reason with her and change
her mind; you have influence.” He laid his gloved
hand on the hand that rested on the wheel. “It
will kill me, Mystic, if she doesn’t marry me.”
</p>
<p>
So weak, so pitiful! She could have cried. And
all for love of flighty Sue Greyson!
</p>
<p>
“I was sure that she would accept me. She has
done every thing <em>but</em> accept me. I did not know
that a woman would permit a man to take her day
after day into his arms and kiss her unless she intended
to marry him. Would <em>you</em> permit that?” he
asked.
</p>
<p>
“You know that I would not,” she answered
proudly; “but Sue doesn’t know any better; all
she cares for is the ‘fun’ of the moment.”
</p>
<p>
“I have been hoping so long; since Towne went
away; I can’t bear this.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>
</p>
<p>
“There is as much strength for you as for any
of us,” she said gently.
</p>
<p>
“But I am too weak to hold it.”
</p>
<p>
And he looked too weak to hold it. She could
not lift her full eyes. “I am so sorry,” was all she
could speak.
</p>
<p>
“There isn’t any thing worth living for anyway;
I, for one, am not thankful for my ‘creation.’ I
wish I was dead and buried and out of sight forever.
Sue Greyson has another offer to whisper to
all Dunellen. I would not stay here, I would go
back to that wretched hospital, but my engagement
with her father extends through another year.
Well, you won’t ride home with me?”
</p>
<p>
“Not to-day, I want to be out in this air.”
</p>
<p>
“And you don’t want to be shut in here with
my growling. I don’t blame you; I’d run away
from myself if I could. I’ll kill half Dunellen and
all Mayfield with overdoses before another night,
and then take a big dose myself. Say, Mystic, you
are posted in these things, where would be the
harm?”
</p>
<p>
“Take it and see.”
</p>
<p>
“Not yet awhile. I am not sure of many things,
but I <em>am</em> sure that a man’s life in this world will
stare in his face in the next. And my life has not
been fit even for your eyes.”
</p>
<p>
Homely, shabby, old, worn, excited, with a sharp
ring in his voice and a stoop in his shoulders.
What was there in him to touch Sue Greyson?
Where was the first point of sympathy?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>
</p>
<p>
Tessa could have taken him into her arms and
cared for him as she would have cared for a child.
</p>
<p>
“I have just seen an old man die; a good old
man; he was over ninety; he prayed to the last;
that is his lips moved and his old wife laid his
hands together; he liked to clasp his hands when
he prayed, she said. She put her ear down close
to his mouth, but she could not distinguish the
words. I was wishing that I could go in his
place, and that he could take up my life and live
it through for me. He would do better with it
than I shall.”
</p>
<p>
“Is not that rather selfish?”
</p>
<p>
“Life is such a sham. I don’t believe in the
transmigration of souls; I don’t want to come back
and pull through another miserable existence.”
</p>
<p>
“I want you to stay this soul in this body; I do
not want to lose you.”
</p>
<p>
“If every woman in the world were like you—”
</p>
<p>
“And every man were as tired and hungry as
you—”
</p>
<p>
“What would he do?”
</p>
<p>
“He would hurry home to a good, hot dinner.”
</p>
<p>
“I have not eaten or drank since yesterday morning.
Sue has a hot dinner waiting for me. She
will sit with me while I eat, and tell me, perhaps,
that she has had a letter from that fellow in Philadelphia,
or that that well-preserved specimen of
manhood, old John Gesner, has asked her to drive
with him. Some flirtation of hers is sauce to every
dish.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
</p>
<p>
“Poor Sue,” sighed Tessa.
</p>
<p>
“She might be happy if she would; I would take
care of her.”
</p>
<p>
“Good-by,” squeezing his fingers through his
glove. “Go home and eat.”
</p>
<p>
“Give me a good word before I go.”
</p>
<p>
“Wait.”
</p>
<p>
“Is that the best word you know?”
</p>
<p>
“It is good enough.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, good day, Mystic,” he said, lifting his hat.
</p>
<p>
She went back to the grassy wayside, thinking.
What right had Sue Greyson’s light fingers to meddle
with a life like Dr. Lake’s? They had not one
taste in common. How could he find her attractive?
She disliked every thing in which he was interested;
it was true that she could sing, sing like
one of the wild birds down in the woods, and he
loved music.
</p>
<p>
She paused and stood leaning against the rails
of a fence, and looked across the green acres of
winter wheat; one day in September she had stood
there watching the men as they were drilling the
wheat; afterward she had seen the tender, green
blades springing up in straight rows, and once she
had seen the whole field green beneath a light
snow. The wind moved her veil slightly, both
hands were drooping as her elbows leaned upon
the upper rail, her cheeks were tinged with the
excitement of Dr. Lake’s words, and her eyes suffused
with a mist that was too sorrowful to drop
with tears. A quick step on the grass at her side
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>
did not startle her; she did not stir until a voice
propounded gravely: “If a man should be born
with two heads, on which forehead must he wear
the phylactery?”
</p>
<p>
She turned with a laugh. “Gus, I would know
that was you if I heard the voice and the question
in the Great Desert.”
</p>
<p>
“Can’t you decide?”
</p>
<p>
“My thoughts were not nonsense.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course not, you were labelling and pigeon
holing all that you have thought of since sunrise!
I’ve been sitting on a stone waiting for your conference
to end. Are you in the habit of meeting
strange men and conversing with them.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I came out to meet you.”
</p>
<p>
“I only wish you did! I wish that you would
make a stranger of me and be polite to me. It is
nothing new for you to be wandering on a Saturday
afternoon, and nothing new for you to find me.”
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t find you.”
</p>
<p>
“I intended to give you the honor of the discovery;
now we will share the glory. Shall we
go on?”
</p>
<p>
“I have been to my roots; do you know my
roots? Do you know the corner above Old Place
and the tiny stream?”
</p>
<p>
“I know every corner, and every root, and every
stream. Shall I carry your flowers for you? I
never can see why I should relieve a maiden of a
burden when her avoirdupois equals mine. You
will not give them to me? I have something to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>
read to you—something of my own composing—I
composed it in one brilliant wakeful moment—you
will appreciate it.”
</p>
<p>
“I do not believe it.”
</p>
<p>
“Wait until you hear it. Lady Blue, are you
going to be literary and never be married! Woe
to the day when I taught you all you know.”
</p>
<p>
They went on, slowly, for she liked to talk to
Mr. Hammerton. “Father said something like that
this morning and it troubled me; why may I not
do as I like best? Why should he care to see me
married before he dies?”
</p>
<p>
“Why should he not?”
</p>
<p>
“Nonsense. I can take good care of myself; beside,”
with a mischievous glance into his serious
eyes, “I really don’t know whom to marry.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you could easily find some one. If all else
fail, come to me, and if I am not too busy I will
take you into consideration.”
</p>
<p>
“Thanks, good friend! But you will always be
too busy. What have you to read to me?”
</p>
<p>
“Something that you will appreciate. I wrote
it for you. Stay, sit down, while I read it.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t want to. You can read and walk. The
mother of Mrs. Hemans could read aloud while
walking up hill.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Hammerton’s voice was not pleasant to a
stranger, but Tessa liked it because it belonged to
him; it was a part of him like his big nose, his
spectacles, and the tiny bald spot over which, every
day, he carefully brushed his hair. The color in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>
his cheeks was as pretty as a girl’s, and so was the
delicate whiteness of his forehead; the bushy mustache,
however, made amends for the complexion
that he sometimes regretted; Tessa had once told
him that his big nose, his mustache, and his awkwardness
were all that kept him from being as
pretty as his sister.
</p>
<p>
“I am not the mother of Mrs. Hemans.” He
took a sheet of paper from his pocket-book, and
showed her the poem written in his peculiarly plain,
upright hand.
</p>
<p>
“Excuse my singing and I will read. You must
not think of any thing else.”
</p>
<p>
“I will not.”
</p>
<p>
“You are walking too fast.”
</p>
<p>
She obediently took slower steps.
</p>
<p>
He cleared his throat and, holding the paper near
his eyes, began to read. A shadow gathered in his
listener’s eyes at the first four lines.
</p>

</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span></div>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The&nbsp;&nbsp;people&nbsp;&nbsp;that&nbsp;&nbsp;stood&nbsp;&nbsp;below<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She&nbsp;&nbsp;knew&nbsp;&nbsp;but&nbsp;&nbsp;little&nbsp;&nbsp;about;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And&nbsp;&nbsp;this&nbsp;&nbsp;story’s&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;moral,&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;know,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If&nbsp;&nbsp;you’ll&nbsp;&nbsp;try&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;find&nbsp;&nbsp;it&nbsp;&nbsp;out.”<br />
</p>
<p>
“How did you know that I need that?” she
asked, taking it from his hand. “Who wrote it?”
</p>
<p>
“I did.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you know?”
</p>
<p>
“No. I don’t know. I copied it for you.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you. I thank you very much. You
could not have brought me any thing better.”
</p>
<p>
“I brought you a piece of news, too.”
</p>
<p>
“As good as the poem?”
</p>
<p>
“Nan Gerard thinks so. She is to be married
and to live at Old Place; our castle in the air.”
</p>
<p>
“Old Place isn’t my castle in the air. Who told
you?”
</p>
<p>
“A woman’s question. I never told a woman a
secret yet that she did not reply, ‘Who told you?’
Mary Sherwood told me, of course. Do you congratulate
Naughty Nan?”
</p>
<p>
“Must I?”
</p>
<p>
“It’s queer that I do not know that man. I
have missed an introduction a thousand times.
Do you congratulate her?”
</p>
<p>
“I am supposed to congratulate <em>him</em>. He is
very lovable.”
</p>
<p>
“I thought that only women were that.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s an admission,” laughed Tessa, “you
cross old bachelor.”
</p>
<p>
“You learned that from Dine.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>
</p>
<p>
“No, I learned it from you.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa talked rapidly and lightly, perhaps, because
she did not feel like talking at all.
</p>
<p>
Would he marry Nan Gerard? Why could she
not be glad for Nan Gerard? Why must she be
just a little sorry for herself? Why must it make
a difference to her? Why must the weight of the
flowers be too heavy for her hand, and why must
she give them that toss over a fence across a field?
</p>
<p>
“Your pretty flowers,” expostulated Mr. Hammerton.
</p>
<p>
“I do not care for them; they were withering.”
</p>
<p>
“I have a thought; I wonder why it should
come to me; I am wondering if you and I walk
together here a year from to-day what we shall
be talking about. My prophetic soul reveals to
me that a year makes a difference sometimes.”
</p>
<p>
“I remember a year ago to-day,” she answered.
“A year <em>has</em> made a difference.”
</p>
<p>
“Not to you or me?”
</p>
<p>
“To Nan Gerard?” she answered seriously.
</p>
<p>
“But that does not affect us.”
</p>
<p>
Did it not? A year ago to-day Ralph Towne
had brought her some English violets, and she had
pressed them and thrown a thought about him
and about them into a poem. To-day had he taken
violets to Nan Gerard?
</p>
<p>
“Lady Blue; you are absent-minded.”
</p>
<p>
“Am I? I was only labelling and pigeon-holing
a thought; it is to be laid away to moulder
with the dust of ages.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>
</p>
<p>
“A thought that can not be spoken?”
</p>
<p>
“A thought that it was folly to think, and that
would be worse than folly to speak.”
</p>
<p>
If he replied she did not hear; they sauntered
on, she keeping the path and he walking on the
grass.
</p>
<p>
A carriage passed, driving slowly. The two ladies
within watched the pedestrians,—a fair-faced
girl with thoughtful eyes, and a tall man with an
intellectual face,—as if they were a part of the landscape
of the spring.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘In&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;spring&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;young&nbsp;&nbsp;man’s&nbsp;&nbsp;fancy—’”<br />
</p>
<p>
laughingly quoted one of them.
</p>
<p>
“Will she accept or refuse him?” asked the other.
</p>
<p>
“If she do either it will be once and forever,”
was the reply seriously given. “Did you notice her
mouth? She has been very much troubled, but she
can be made very glad.”
</p>
<p>
After the carriage had passed, Mr. Hammerton
spoke, “I am glad we amused those people; they
failed to decide whether or not we are lovers.”
</p>
<p>
“They have very little penetration, then,” said
Tessa. “I am too languid and you are too unconscious.”
</p>
<p>
“There is nothing further to be said; you do not
know what you have nipped in the bud.”
</p>
<p>
“I suppose we never know that.”
</p>
<p>
Dinah met them at the gate, her wind-blown
curls and laughing eyes in striking contrast to the
older face that had lost all its color. Tessa did not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>
see that Mr. Hammerton’s eyes were studying the
change in her face; she had no more care of the
changes in her face with him than with Dinah.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll be in about eight,” he said to Dinah, as Tessa
brushed past him to enter the gate.
</p>
<p>
Another thing that influenced impressible Tessa
this day, was a talk at the tea-table. They were
sitting around the tea-table cozily, the four people
who, in her mother’s thought, constituted all Tessa’s
world. Mr. Wadsworth in an easy position in his
arm-chair was listening to his three girls and deciding
that his little wife was really the handsomest
and sprightliest woman that he had ever seen,
that happy little Dine was as bewitching as she
could well be, and that Tessa, the light of his eyes,
was like no one else in all the world. Not that any
stranger sitting in his arm-chair would have looked
through his eyes, but he was an old man, disappointed
in his life, and his three girls were all of
earth and a part of heaven to him. They were all
talking and he was satisfied to listen. “I believe
that some girls are born without a mother’s heart,”
Mrs. Wadsworth said in reply to a story of Dine’s
about a young mother in Dunellen who had slapped
her baby, saying that she hated it and was nothing
but a slave to it! “Now, here’s Tessa. <em>She</em> has no
motherliness. Only this morning Freddie Stone fell
down near the gate and hurt his head; his screams
were terrifying, but she went on working and let
him scream. As I said it is all as girls are born.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” answered Tessa, in the deliberate way in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
which she had schooled herself to reply to her
mother, “I know that your last assertion is true.
There was a lady in school, a teacher of mathematics,
she acknowledged that she did not love her
own little girls as other mothers seemed to do.
She stated it as she would have stated any fact in
geometry; perhaps she thought that she was no
more responsible for one than for the other. The
mere fact of motherhood does not bring mother
love within; any mother that does not give to her
child a true idea of the mother-heart of God fails
utterly in being a mother. She may be a nurse, a
paid nurse, or a nurse upon compulsion; any hired
nurse can wash a child’s face, can tie its sash and
make pretty things for it to wear, and <em>any</em> nurse,
who was never mother to a child, can teach it what
God means when He says, ‘as a mother comforteth.’
Miss Jewett could not be happier in her Bible class
girls if they were all her own children; she
says so herself. Mary Sherwood said to her one
day, ‘If my mother were like you, how different I
should have been!’”
</p>
<p>
“Such a case is an exception,” returned Mrs.
Wadsworth excitedly.
</p>
<p>
“Nineteen out of her twenty-three girls tell her
their troubles when they would not tell their own
mothers,” said Dinah. “She has twenty-three secret
drawers to keep their secrets in.”
</p>
<p>
“She has time to listen to fol-de-rol. She advises
them all to marry for some silly notion and
let a good home slip, I’ve no doubt.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
</p>
<p>
“I expect that twenty-one of her girls have refused
John Gesner,” laughed Mr. Wadsworth. “He
will have to bribe Miss Jewett to let them alone.”
</p>
<p>
“Only twenty, father,” said Dine. “Tessa and
Sue and I are waiting to do it.”
</p>
<p>
“I will make this house too uncomfortable for
the one of you that does refuse him.”
</p>
<p>
“Mother! mother!” remonstrated Mr. Wadsworth
gently.
</p>
<p>
“He’ll never have the honor,” said Dine. “Mr.
Lewis Gesner is the gentleman; I have always admired
him. Haven’t you, Tessa?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; I like to shake hands with him; he has a
trustworthy face.”
</p>
<p>
“So much for the mothers of Dunellen, Tessa;
how about the fathers? Would the girls like to
have Miss Jewett for a father, too?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, the fathers have the bread-winning to do.
If the mothers do not understand, we can not expect
the fathers to understand. There was a girl
at school who had had a hard home experience;
she told me that she never repeated the second
word of the Lord’s prayer; that she said instead:
Our Lord, who art in heaven?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, deary me! How dreadful!” cried Dinah,
moving nearer the arm-chair and dropping her
head on her father’s shoulder. “Didn’t she <em>ever</em>
learn to say it?”
</p>
<p>
“Not while we were at school.”
</p>
<p>
“Tessa, you can talk,” said her mother.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said Tessa, humbly, “I can talk.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
</p>
<p>
“She was a very wicked girl,” continued Mrs.
Wadsworth. “I don’t see how she dared; I should
think that she would have been afraid of dying in
her sleep as a judgment sent upon her.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps she did not repeat the prayer as a
charm,” answered Tessa, in her clearest tones.
</p>
<p>
Dinah lifted her head to laugh.
</p>
<p>
“You upheld her, no doubt,” declared Mrs. Wadsworth.
</p>
<p>
“I sympathized with her as they who never had
a pain can feel for the sick,” said Tessa, smiling
into her father’s eyes.
</p>
<p>
“How did you talk to her?” asked Dine.
</p>
<p>
“What is talk? I only told her to wait and she
would know.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s easy to talk,” said Mrs. Wadsworth uncomfortably.
“You can talk an hour about sympathy,
but you didn’t run out to Freddie Stone.”
</p>
<p>
“Why didn’t you?” inquired her father seriously.
</p>
<p>
Tessa laughed, while Dine answered.
</p>
<p>
“Mother was there talking as fast as she could
talk, Bridget was there with a basin of water and
a sponge, Mrs. Bird had run over, a carriage with
two ladies, a coachman and a footman had stopped
to look on, and oh, I was there too. He was somewhat
bloody.”
</p>
<p>
“You are excused, daughter. Save your energies
for a time of greater need.”
</p>
<p>
“Energies! Need!” tartly exclaimed Mrs. Wadsworth.
“If she begins to be literary, she will care
for nothing else.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
</p>
<p>
“I see no evidence of a lessening interest yet,”
replied her father.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I might know that you would encourage
her. She might as well have the small-pox as
far as her prospects go! A needle is a woman’s
weapon.”
</p>
<p>
“You forget her tongue, mother,” suggested
Dine. “Oh, Tessa, what is that about a needle;
Mrs. Browning says it.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa repeated:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘A&nbsp;&nbsp;woman&nbsp;&nbsp;takes&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;housewife&nbsp;&nbsp;from&nbsp;&nbsp;her&nbsp;&nbsp;breast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And&nbsp;&nbsp;plucks&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;delicatest&nbsp;&nbsp;needle&nbsp;&nbsp;out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As&nbsp;&nbsp;’twere&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;rose,&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;pricks&nbsp;&nbsp;you&nbsp;&nbsp;carefully<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’Neath&nbsp;&nbsp;nails,&nbsp;&nbsp;’neath&nbsp;&nbsp;eyelids,&nbsp;&nbsp;in&nbsp;&nbsp;your&nbsp;&nbsp;nostrils,—say,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;beast&nbsp;&nbsp;would&nbsp;&nbsp;roar&nbsp;&nbsp;so&nbsp;&nbsp;tortured—but&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;man,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;human&nbsp;&nbsp;creature,&nbsp;&nbsp;must&nbsp;&nbsp;not,&nbsp;&nbsp;shall&nbsp;&nbsp;not&nbsp;&nbsp;flinch,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No,&nbsp;&nbsp;not&nbsp;&nbsp;for&nbsp;&nbsp;shame.’”<br />
</p>
<p>
“Some woman wrote that when she’d have done
better to be sewing for her husband, I’ll warrant,”
commented Mrs. Wadsworth. Mr. Wadsworth
looked grave.
</p>
<p>
“Oh she had a literary husband,” replied Tessa,
mischievously. “A word that rhymed with supper
would do instead of bread and butter; and he cared
more for one of her poems than he did for his
buttons.”
</p>
<p>
“Literary men don’t grow on every bush; and
they don’t take to literary women, either,” said her
mother.
</p>
<p>
“Mother, you forget the Howitts, William and
Mary; what good, good times they have taking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>
long walks and writing; like you and Gus, Tessa,
and Mr. and Mrs. Browning—”
</p>
<p>
“You don’t find such people in Dunellen; <em>we</em> live
in Dunellen. Gus will choose a woman that doesn’t
care for books, and so will Mr. Towne, mark my
words! And so will Felix Harrison, even if he is
killing himself with study.”
</p>
<p>
“He is improving greatly,” said Mr. Wadsworth,
pulling one of Dine’s long curls straight. “He is
going away Monday to finish his studies.”
</p>
<p>
“I honor him,” said Tessa, flushing slightly.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t,” said Dine, “he sha’n’t have you, Tessa.
Don’t honor him.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s all you and your father think of—keeping
Tessa. She needs the wear and tear of married
life to give her character.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s queer about that,” rejoined Tessa in a perplexed
tone, playing with her napkin ring. “If
such discipline <em>be</em> the best, why is any woman
permitted to be without it? Why does not the
fitting husband appear as soon as the girl begins
to wish for him? In the East, where it is shameful
for a girl not to be married at eleven, I have
yet to learn that the wives are noted for strength
or beauty of character.”
</p>
<p>
“You may talk,” said her mother, heatedly, “but
two years hence <em>you</em> will dance in a brass kettle.”
</p>
<p>
“I hope that I shall work in it,” answered Tessa,
coloring painfully, however. Whether her lips
were touched with a slight contempt, or tremulous
because she was very, very much hurt, Dinah could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>
not decide; she was silent because she could not
think of any thing sharp enough to reply; she never
liked to be <em>too</em> saucy.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Wadsworth spoke in his genial voice: “It’s
a beautiful thing, daughters, to help a good man
live a good life.”
</p>
<p>
Dinah thought: “I would love to do such a beautiful
thing.” Tessa was saying to herself, “Oh,
what should I do if my father were to die!”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Wadsworth pushed back his chair, went
around to his wife and kissed her. Tessa loved
him for it.
</p>
<p>
“You have helped a good man, a good old man,
haven’t you, fairy?” he said, smoothing the hair
that was as pretty as Dinah’s.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” answered his wife, and Tessa shivered
from head to foot. “People all said that you were
a different man after you were married.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m going over to Norah’s,” cried Dinah. “I
told her that I would come to write our French
together. And, oh, father! I forgot to tell you,
Gus will be in about eight.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know that I care for chess; I can not
concentrate my attention as I could a year ago.”
</p>
<p>
“Why do you run off if he is coming?” asked
Mrs. Wadsworth.
</p>
<p>
“He comes too often to be attended to,” Dine
answered. “Won’t you be around, Tessa?”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa had resolved to give the evening to writing
letters, and was passing through the dining-room with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
a china candlestick in her hand, when
her father, reading Shakespeare at the round table,
on which stood a shaded lamp, detained her by
catching at her dress.
</p>
<p>
“Set your light down, daughter, and stay a
moment.”
</p>
<p>
With her hand upon his shoulder, she looked
down over the page he was reading:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Heaven&nbsp;&nbsp;doth&nbsp;&nbsp;with&nbsp;&nbsp;us&nbsp;&nbsp;as&nbsp;&nbsp;we&nbsp;&nbsp;with&nbsp;&nbsp;torches&nbsp;&nbsp;do;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not&nbsp;&nbsp;light&nbsp;&nbsp;them&nbsp;&nbsp;for&nbsp;&nbsp;themselves—’”<br />
</p>
<p>
she read aloud.
</p>
<p>
“I made my will to-day,” he said quietly; “that
is, I changed it. Lewis Gesner and Gus Hammerton,
my tried friends, were in the office at the time.
If you ever need a friend, daughter, any thing done
for you that Gus can not do—I count on him as the
friend of my girls for life—go to Lewis Gesner.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t want a friend; I have you.”
</p>
<p>
“If I should tell your mother about the will she
would go into hysterics, and Dine would be sure
that I am going to die; I have divided my little
all equally among my three. That is, all but this
house and garden, which I have given to my elder
daughter, Theresa Louise. It is to be hers solely,
without any gainsaying. Your mother will fume
when the fact is made known to her, but I give it
to you that my three girls may always have a
roof, humble though it be, over their heads. The
old man did not know how to make money, but he
left them enough to be comfortable all their lives
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
there was never any need that his wife should worry
and work, or that his daughter should marry for a
home. Very good record for the old man; eh,
daughter?”
</p>
<p>
She laid her cheek against the bald forehead and
put both arms around his neck.
</p>
<p>
“And, Tessa, child, your mother is half right
about you; don’t have any notions about marriage;
promise me that you will marry—for you will, some
day—but for the one best reason.”
</p>
<p>
“What is that?” she asked roguishly. “How
am I to know?”
</p>
<p>
“What do you think?”
</p>
<p>
“Because somebody needs me and I can do him
good.”
</p>
<p>
“A Hottentot might urge that; you will find the
reason in time. Don’t make an idol; that is your
temperament.”
</p>
<p>
“I know it.”
</p>
<p>
“And above all things don’t sacrifice yourself;
few men appreciate being done good to! I know
men, they are terribly human. Gus Hammerton is
a fine fellow.”
</p>
<p>
“<em>He</em> is terribly human,” she answered with a little
laugh.
</p>
<p>
“Am I harsh towards your mother ever, do you
think?” he asked in a changed tone.
</p>
<p>
“Why, <em>no</em>,” she exclaimed in surprise.
</p>
<p>
“I used to be. I tried to mould her. Don’t <em>you</em>
ever try to mould any body; now run away to your
work or to your book! Don’t sigh over me, I am
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>
‘well and hearty.’ How short my life seems when
I look back. Such dreams as I had. It’s all right,
though.”
</p>
<p>
She could not run away, for the door-bell, in answer
to a most decided pull, detained her; she
opened it, expecting to see Mr. Hammerton, but
to her surprise, and but slightly to her pleasure,
Felix Harrison stood there in broad-shouldered
health.
</p>
<p>
“Good evening,” she said with some bewilderment.
</p>
<p>
“Do I startle you?” he asked in the old gracious,
winning manner. “May I come in?”
</p>
<p>
“I am very glad to see you. Will you walk into
my parlor, Mr. Fly?”
</p>
<p>
The one tall candle in the china candlestick was
the only light in the room. She set it upon the table,
saying, “Excuse me, and I will bring a light,
that we may the better look at each other. The
light of other days is hardly sufficient.”
</p>
<p>
“It is enough for me,” he said, pushing the ottoman
towards one of the low arm-chairs. “Sit down
and I will take the ottoman. The parrot recognizes
me.”
</p>
<p>
Her hand moved nervously on the arm of her
chair; the hand was larger now than when it
had spilled ink on his copy-book, larger even than
when it had written her first, shy, proud, indignant
refusal.
</p>
<p>
“You are not the tempest you used to be,” he
said smiling after a survey of her face.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
</p>
<p>
“<em>Wasn’t</em> I a tempest? I have outgrown my little
breezes. In time I may become as gentle as a
zephyr.”
</p>
<p>
“You always were gentle enough.”
</p>
<p>
“Not to you.”
</p>
<p>
“Not to me when I tormented you.”
</p>
<p>
“Probably I should not be gentle if I were tormented
now.”
</p>
<p>
She had never decided to which of the five thousand
shades of green Felix Harrison’s eyes belonged;
they were certainly green; one of the
English poets had green eyes, she wondered if
they were like Felix Harrison’s. To-night they
glittered as if they were no color at all. This face
beside her was a spiritualized face; a strong mouth
as sweet as a woman’s, a round benevolent chin; a
low, square forehead; hair as light as her own; his
side face as he turned at least five years younger
than the full face; she had often laughed at his
queer fashion of growing old and growing young.
At times, in the years when they were more together
than of late, he had changed so greatly that,
after not having seen him for several days she had
passed him in the street without recognition; these
times had been in those indignant times after she
had refused him; that they were more than indignant
times to him she was made painfully aware
by these changes in his rugged face.
</p>
<p>
“I have been thinking over those foolish times,”
she said, breaking the silence. “I am glad that
you came in to-night; I am in a mood for confessing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>
my wrong-doings; I have said many quick
words; you know you always had the talent for
irritating me.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I always worried you.”
</p>
<p>
“You did not intend to,” she said hastily, watching
the movement of his lips; “we did not understand,
that is all. It takes longer than a summer
and a winter for heart to answer to heart.”
</p>
<p>
“We have known each other many summers
and many winters.”
</p>
<p>
“And now we are old, sensible, hard-working
people; having given up all nonsense we are discovering
the sense there is in sense.”
</p>
<p>
He turned his face with a listening look in his
eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Did not some one come in? Shall we be disturbed?”
</p>
<p>
“Not unless we wish to be. It is only Mr. Hammerton,
he is a great friend of father’s. He renews
his youth in him.”
</p>
<p>
“Is he not <em>your</em> friend?”
</p>
<p>
How well she remembered his suspicious, exacting
questions!
</p>
<p>
“He is my best friend,” she said proudly.
</p>
<p>
“I wish I was in heaven,” he said, his voice
grown weak. “Every thing goes wrong with me;
every thing has gone wrong all my life. Father
is in a rage because I will not stay home; he offered
me to-day the deed for two hundred acres as
a bribe. I should be stronger to-day but that he
worked my life out when I was a growing boy.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
</p>
<p>
“A country life is best for you. Your old homestead
is the loveliest place around, with its deep
eaves and dormer-windows and vines. That wide
hall is one of my pleasant recollections, and the
porch that looks into the garden, the blue hills
away off, and the cool woods, the thrushes and the
robins and the whip-poor-will at twilight; that solitary
note sets me to crying, or it used to when I
dreamed dreams and told them to Laura! I hope
that Laura will love the place too well to leave it;
it is my ideal of a home; much more than splendid
Old Place is.”
</p>
<p>
“I will stay if you will come and live in it with
me,” he said quietly.
</p>
<p>
“I like my own home better,” she answered as
quietly. “Are you stronger than you were?”
</p>
<p>
“Much stronger. I have not had one of those
attacks since March. Lake warns me; but I am
twice the man that he is! How he coughed last
winter! I haven’t any thing to live for, anyway.”
</p>
<p>
“It is very weak for you to say that.”
</p>
<p>
“Whose fault is it that I am so weak? Whose
fault is it that my life is spoiled? You have spoiled
every thing for me by playing fast and loose with
me.”
</p>
<p>
“I never did that,” she answered indignantly.
“You accuse me wrongfully.”
</p>
<p>
“Every time you speak to me or look at me you
give me hope; an hour with you I live on for
months. O, Tessa,” dropping his head in both
hands, “I have loved you all my life.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>
</p>
<p>
“I know it,” she said solemnly. “Can’t you be
brave and bear it?”
</p>
<p>
“I <em>am</em> bearing it. I am bearing it and it is
killing me. You never had the water ebb and
flow, ebb and flow when you were dying of thirst.
Women can not suffer; they are heartless, all their
heart is used in causing men to suffer. A touch
of your hand, the color in your cheek, a dropping
of your eyes, talks to me and tells me a lie; and
then you go up-stairs and kneel down to Him, who
is the truth-maker! You are a covenant-breaker.
You have looked at me scores of times as if you
loved me; you have told me that you like to be
with me; and when I come to you and ask you like
a man to become my wife, you blush and falter, and
answer like a woman—<em>no</em>. I beg your pardon—”
</p>
<p>
The tears stood in her eyes but would not fall.
</p>
<p>
“I did not come here to upbraid you. I did not
start from home with the intention of coming; but
I saw you through the window with your arms
around your father’s neck and I thought, ‘Her
heart is soft to-night; she will listen to me.’ I
was drawn in, as you always draw me, against my
better judgment. I shall not trouble you again; I
am going away. Tessa,” suddenly snatching both
hands, “if you are so sorry for me, why can’t you
love me?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” not withdrawing her hands,
“something hinders. I honor you. I admire you.
Your love for me is a great rest to me; I want to
wrap myself up in it and go to sleep; I do not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
want to give it up—no one else loves me, and I <em>do</em>
want somebody to love me.”
</p>
<p>
“I will love you; only let me. Marry me and I
will stay at home; I will do for you all that a human
heart and two human hands can do; I will <em>be</em>
to you all that you will help me to be.”
</p>
<p>
“But I do not want to marry you,” she said perplexed.
“I should have to give up too much. I
love my home and the people in it better than I
love you.”
</p>
<p>
“I will not take you away; you shall have them
all; you shall come to them and they shall come
to you; remember that I have never loved any
one but you—” the great tears were rolling down
his cheeks. “I am not worth it; I am not worthy
to speak to you, or even to hold your hands
like this.” He broke down utterly, sobbing wearily
and excitedly.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t, oh, don’t,” she cried hurriedly. “I may
grow to love you if you want me to so much,
and you are good and true, I can believe every
word you say—not soon—in two or three years
perhaps.”
</p>
<p>
His tears were on her hands, and he had loved
her all her life; no one else loved her, no one else
ever would love her like this; he was good and
true, and she wanted some one to love her; she
wanted to be sure of love somewhere and then to
go to sleep. Her father should see her married before
he died; her mother would never—
</p>
<p>
“You have promised,” he cried, in a thick voice.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>
“You have promised and you never break your
word.”
</p>
<p>
“I have promised and I never break my word;
but you must not speak of it to any one, not even
to Laura, and I will not tell father, or Gus, or Miss
Jewett, or Dine; no one must guess it for one year—it
is so sudden and strange! I couldn’t bear to
hear it spoken of; and if you are very gentle and
do not <em>try</em> to make me love you—you must not
kiss me, or put your arms around me, you know
I never did like that, and perhaps that is one
reason why I never liked you before—you must
let me alone, let love come of itself and grow of
itself.”
</p>
<p>
“I will,” he uttered brokenly, and rose up trembling
from head to foot. “May God bless you!—bless
you!—bless you!”
</p>
<p>
It was better for him to leave her; the strain had
been too great for both.
</p>
<p>
“I must be alone; I must go out under the stars
and thank God.”
</p>
<p>
She lifted her face to his and kissed him. How
unutterably glad and thankful she was in all her
life afterward that she gave that kiss unasked.
</p>
<p>
“God bless you, my darling,” he said tenderly,
“and He <em>will</em> bless you for this.”
</p>
<p>
Bewildered, not altogether unhappy, she sat alone
while he went out under the stars.
</p>
<p>
Was this the end of all her girlhood’s dreams?
</p>
<p>
Only Felix Harrison! Must she pass all her life
with him? Must her father and mother and Gus
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>
and Dine be not so much to her because Felix Harrison
had become more—had become most? And
Ralph Towne? Ought she to love Felix as she
had loved him?
</p>
<p>
The hurried questions were answerless. She did
not belong to herself; not any more to her father
as she had belonged to him half an hour since with
both her arms around his neck. Love constituted
ownership, and she belonged to Felix through this
mighty right of love; did he belong to her through
the same divine right?
</p>
<p>
He was thanking God and so must she thank
Him.
</p>
<p>
“Tessa,” called her father, “come here, daughter!”
</p>
<p>
With the candle in her hand, she stood in the
door-way of the sitting-room. “Well,” she said.
</p>
<p>
“With whom were you closeted?” asked Mr.
Hammerton, looking up from the chess-board.
</p>
<p>
The effort to speak in her usual tone lent to her
voice a sharpness that startled herself.
</p>
<p>
“Felix Harrison.”
</p>
<p>
“Your old tormentor!” suggested Mr. Hammerton.
</p>
<p>
“Who ever called him that?” She came to the
table, set the candlestick down and looked over
the chess-board.
</p>
<p>
“She has refused him again,” mentally decided
Mr. Hammerton, carefully moving his queen.
</p>
<p>
“I called you, daughter, because Gus withstood
me out and out about ‘Heaven doth with us as we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
with torches do.’ Find it and let his obstinate
eyes behold!”
</p>
<p>
She opened the volume, turning the leaves with
fingers that trembled. “Truly enough,” she was
thinking, “a year from to-day will find a difference.”
</p>
<p>
“Now I am going over for Dine,” she said, after
Mr. Hammerton had acknowledged himself in the
wrong.
</p>
<p>
“Permit me to accompany you,” he said. Even
with Tessa Wadsworth, Gus Hammerton was often
formal. They found Dinah bidding Norah good-by
at Mr. Bird’s gate; they were laughing at nothing,
as usual.
</p>
<p>
“Let us walk to the end of the planks,” suggested
Mr. Hammerton. “On a night like this I
could tramp till sunrise.” He drew Tessa’s arm
through his, saying, “Now, Dine, take the other
fin.”
</p>
<p>
The end of the planks touched a piece of woods;
at the entrance of the wood stood an old building,
windowless, doorless, chimneyless; the school children
knew that it was haunted.
</p>
<p>
“We’re afraid,” laughed Dine; “the old hut looks
ghostly.”
</p>
<p>
“It <em>is</em> ghostly, I will relate its history. Once
upon a time, upon a dark night, so dark that
I could not see the white horse upon which I
rode—”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, that’s splendid,” cried Dinah, hanging contentedly
upon his arm. “Listen, Tessa.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
</p>
<p>
But Tessa could not listen. She was feeling
the peace that rested over the woods, the fields;
that was enwrapping Old Place, and further down
the dim road the low-eaved homestead that must
thenceforth be home to her. There could be no
more air-castles; her future was decided. She had
turned the leaf and discovered a name that hitherto
had meant so little: Felix Harrison. Not Ralph
Towne; a year ago to-night it was English violets
and Ralph Towne. The peace that brooded over
all might be hers, if only she would be content.
</p>
<p>
At this moment,—while she was trying to be content,
trying to believe that she could interpret the
peace of the shining stars, and while she was hearing
the sound of her companion’s words, a solemn,
even tone that rolled on in unison with her
thoughts,—two people far away were thinking of
her; thinking of her, but not wishing and not
daring to speak her name.
</p>
<p>
“I can not understand, Ralph. I was sure that
we would bring Naughty Nan away with us.”
</p>
<p>
“Truly, mother, I would have pleased you, if I
could.”
</p>
<p>
“You are too serious for her; with all her mischievous
advances,—like a white kitten provokingly
putting out its paw,—she was more than
half afraid of you.”
</p>
<p>
“It does not hurt her to be afraid.”
</p>
<p>
“She is most bewitching.”
</p>
<p>
“Now, mother! But it is too late; she will understand
by my parting words that I do not expect to see her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>
soon again. In my mind is a
memory that has kept me from loving that delicious
Naughty Nan.”
</p>
<p>
“Is the memory a fancy?”
</p>
<p>
“No; it is too real for my ease of mind. If I
were a poet, which I am not, I should think that
her spirit haunted me.”
</p>
<p>
“Can you tell me no more of her? That daughter
that I might have had!”
</p>
<p>
“I do not understand her: she is beyond me, she
baffles me.”
</p>
<p>
“I read of a man once who loved a woman too
well to marry any one else, and yet he did not love
her well enough to marry her.”
</p>
<p>
“Was he a fool?”
</p>
<p>
“Answer the question for yourself. Are <em>you</em> a
fool?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I am. I do not know my own mind. I
should call another man a fool.”
</p>
<p>
“It may not be too late,” she gently urged.
</p>
<p>
“Too late for what?” he asked irritably.
</p>
<p>
“To be wise.”
</p>
<p>
In a few moments he spoke in an abrupt, changed
tone—
</p>
<p>
“Mother! I have decided at last. I shall hang
out my shingle in Dunellen. It is a picturesque
little city, and the climate is as good for you as the
south of France.”
</p>
<p>
“I am very glad,” she answered cordially. “You
are a born physician, you are cool, you are quick,
you are gentle; you can keep your feelings under
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>
perfect control. You are not quite a Stoic, but you
will do very well for one.”
</p>
<p>
“But you will not be happy at Old Place without
me.”
</p>
<p>
“Why should I be without you?”
</p>
<p>
“You have noticed that large, wide brick house
on the opposite side of the Park from Miss Jewett’s?
It has a garden and stable; it is just the house for
us; you may have two rooms thrown into one for
your sitting-room and any other changes that you
please.”
</p>
<p>
“I remember it, I like the situation; there are
English sparrows in the trees.”
</p>
<p>
“We will take that for the present. John Gesner
owns it; he will make his own price if he sees that
I want it, I suppose. I <em>do</em> want it. There are not
many things that I desire more. You and I will
have a green old age at Old Place.”
</p>
<p>
“You forget that I am thirty years older than
you, my son.”
</p>
<p>
By accident, one day, Mrs. Towne had come
across, in one of the drawers of her son’s writing-table,
a large photograph of Tessa Wadsworth, a
vignette, and she had gazed long upon her; the
face was not beautiful, one would not even think
of it as pretty, but it was fine, intellectual, sensitive,
and sweet. In searching for an old letter not
long before leaving home, she had discovered this
picture, defaced and torn into several pieces.
</p>
<p>
“Ralph, you will not be angry with your white-headed
old mother, but were you ever refused?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>
</p>
<p>
“No,” he said, laughing. “A dozen women may
have been ready to refuse me, but not one ever did.”
</p>
<p>
“Nor accepted you, either,” she continued,
shrewdly.
</p>
<p>
He arose and began to pace the floor; after some
turns of excited movement, he came to her and
stood behind her chair. “I know that I have been
accepted; I know that I asked when I did not
intend to ask—that is—I was carried beyond myself;
I asked when I did not know that I was
asking.”
</p>
<p>
“What shall you do now?”
</p>
<p>
“I shall ask in reality; I shall confess myself in
the wrong.”
</p>
<p>
“And she?”
</p>
<p>
“And she? She has the tenderest heart in the
world. She has forgiven me long ago.”
</p>
<p>
“Do not trust her eyes and forget her lips,”
warned his mother. “Love is slain sometimes.”
</p>
<p>
He resumed his walk with a less confident air.
He <em>had</em> forgotten her lips.
</p>
<p>
Would Tessa have cared to hear this? Would
she have forgotten Felix, his blessing and the quiet
of the holy stars?
</p>
<p>
“Oh,” cried Dinah, with her little shout (she
would not have been Dinah without that little
shout), “Oh, Tessa, did you hear?”
</p>
<p>
“She is star-gazing,” said Mr. Hammerton.
</p>
<p>
“It isn’t a true story,” pleaded Dinah. “You
didn’t really see him hanging by the rope and the
woman looking on.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>
</p>
<p>
“My young friend, it is an allegory; that is what
you will drive some man to some day.”
</p>
<p>
“You know I won’t. What is the name of that
bright star?”
</p>
<p>
“It isn’t a star, it’s a planet.”
</p>
<p>
“How do I know the difference?”
</p>
<p>
“Lady Blue knows.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you call her that because her eyes are so
blue or because she is a blue-stocking?”
</p>
<p>
“She is not a blue-stocking; I will not allow it.
It is for her eyes.”
</p>
<p>
“Gus,” said Dinah, “I can’t understand things.”
</p>
<p>
“What things?”
</p>
<p>
“Tennyson’s Dream of Fair Women.”
</p>
<p>
“I shouldn’t think you could. I have spent
hours on it trying to make it out. You look up
Marc Antony and Cleopatra—”
</p>
<p>
“As if I had to.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, look up the daughter of the warrior Gileadite,
and fair Rosamond, and angered Eleanor,
and Fulvia, and Joan of Arc.”
</p>
<p>
“And will you read it to us, and talk all about
it?” cried Dinah in delight. “I like King Lear
when father reads it, but I can’t understand Shakespeare;
he is all conversations.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Hammerton laughed, and patted her head.
“I will bring you the stories that Charles and
Mary Lamb gathered from Shakespeare.”
</p>
<p>
“Shall we turn?” asked Tessa, slipping her hand
through his arm; he instantly imprisoned her fingers.
Felix would be troubled and angry she knew,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
even at this clasp of an old friend’s hand. Jealousy
was his one strong passion; he was jealous of the
books she read, of the letters she received, of every
word spoken to her that he did not hear; she wondered
as her fingers drew themselves free, if he
would ever become jealous of her prayers.
</p>
<p>
She drew a long breath as the weight of her
bondage fell heavier and heavier; and then, he was
so demonstrative, so lavish of his caresses, and her
ideal of a lover was one who held himself aloof,
who kept his hands and his lips to himself. She
sighed more than once as she kept even pace with
the others.
</p>
<p>
“Has the nightingale made a mistake?” asked
Mr. Hammerton, as they were crossing to the gate.
</p>
<p>
“She only made one mistake. I wonder how
many I <em>can</em> make if I do my best to make them.”
</p>
<p>
Dinah opened the gate; her father’s light streamed
through the windows over the garden, down the
path.
</p>
<p>
“Good night,” said Mr. Hammerton. “Oh, I just
remember, what shall I do? I asked my cousin
Mary to go to a lecture on Burns with me to-night,
and I declare! I never thought of it until
this minute.”
</p>
<p>
“Mary Sherwood will give it to you,” said Dinah.
“I wonder what your wife will do with you.”
</p>
<p>
“A wife’s first duty is obedience,” he answered.
</p>
<p>
“I’d like to see the man I’d promise to obey,” said
Dinah, quickly.
</p>
<p>
“I expect you would,” he said gravely.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
</p>
<p>
Dine darted after him to box his ears, words being
impotent, and Tessa went into the house. “I
think I’ll pigeon-hole <em>this</em> day and then go to bed,”
she said, a merry gleam crossing her eyes; “between
my two walks on the planks to-day, I have lived
half a lifetime. I hope Dr. Lake is asleep; I will
never hurt Felix as he is hurt.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span><a name='ch9' id='ch9'></a>IX.—THE NEW MORNING.</h2>
<p>
Her eyes were wide open an hour before the
dawn; as the faint light streamed through the east
and glowed brighter and brighter along the rim of
the south that she could see from her position on
the pillow, she arose, wrapped a shawl about her,
and went to the window to watch the new morning.
On the last night of the old year she had
watched the sunset standing at her western window,
then the light had gone out of her life and all
the world was dark; now, in the new year, her private
and personal new year, the light was rising,
creeping up slowly into the sky, the gold, the faint
rose and the bright rose running into each other,
softening, blending, glowing deeper and deeper as
she watched. This new morning that was an old
morning to so many other eyes that were looking
out upon it; this new morning that would be again
for Dinah, perhaps, and for all the other girls
that were growing up into God’s kingdom on the
earth! The robins in Mr. Bird’s apple orchard
were awake, too, and chanticleer down the road
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>
had proclaimed the opening of another new day
with all his lusty might. She wondered, as she
listened and looked, if Felix were standing in the
light of the morning on the porch, or he might be
walking up and down the long garden path. And
thanking God? She wished that she were thanking
God. She was thanking Him for the light, the
colors, the refreshing, misty air, the robins and
the white and pink wealth of apple blossoms; but
she was not thanking Him because Felix Harrison
loved her.
</p>
<p>
“And that night they caught nothing.”
</p>
<p>
The words repeated themselves with startling
clearness. What connection could they possibly
have with the sunrise? Oh, now she knew; it
was because the fishermen had seen the Lord upon
the shore in the morning.
</p>
<p>
<em>She</em> had caught nothing; all her night of toil
had been fruitless; she had striven and hoped and
dreamed, oh, how she had dreamed of all that she
would do and become! And now she could not be
glad of any thing.
</p>
<p>
The years had ended in having Felix Harrison
love her; that was all. She had lived her childhood
and girlhood through for such a time as this.
</p>
<p>
This new year had brought more hard things to
bear than any of the old years; if she could only
tell some one who would care and sympathize with
her and help her not only to bear but to do and to
become; but her father would be justly angry and
exclaim, “Madness, daughter,” her mother would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
laugh and look perplexed, Miss Jewett would say,
“O, Tessa, Tessa, I didn’t think such a thing of
you,” and Mr. Towne—but she had no right to
think of him! And Gus! He would look at her
steadily and say nothing; he would be disappointed
in her if he knew that she could promise with
her lips, with no love in her heart save the love of
regret, compassion, and contrition for all that she
had so unconsciously caused him to suffer. And
how could she reveal to Felix, poor Felix! the
plain, cold truth! how she shrank from him as
soon as she was alone and could think! how as
the morning grew brighter and her world more
real she shrank from him yet more and more! how
the very thought of his presence, of his tight arms
around her, and his smooth face close to hers gave
her a feeling of repulsion that she had never felt
towards any human being before! She felt that she
must flee to the ends of the earth rather than to
endure him. But it was done; she must keep her
word; he should never guess; she would write a
note and slip it into his hand to-day, he would be
sure to press through the crowd towards her as she
came out of church. She would write it now and
be at rest. Her writing-desk stood open, pages of
manuscript were laid upon it. She selected a sheet
of lemon-colored note paper, and wrote a message,
hurriedly, in pencil. Never afterward would she
write a word upon lemon-colored paper.
</p>
<p>
“Do not come to me, dear Felix—” she hesitated
over the adjective, erased the words, and dropped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>
the sheet into her waste paper basket and found
another: “Do not come to me, Felix, until I send
for you, please. I am not strong. I want to be
alone. Do not think me unkind, you know that I
always did like to be alone. Do not expect too
much of me; I am not what you think; I am a
weak, impulsive woman, too tender-hearted to be
wise, or to be just towards myself or towards you.
If you want me to love you, ask it of Him, who
is love; do not ask it of me, I am not love. But
do not be troubled, I have given my word, I am
not a covenant-breaker, <em>I will be true</em>.”
</p>
<p>
She folded it, not addressing it, and placed it in
the pocket of the dress that she would wear to
church; as she passed the window she saw Dr.
Lake driving towards home. Shivering, although
the sun was high enough to shine on the apple
blossoms, she crept back to bed, nestling close to
sleepy Dine who loved her morning nap better
than the sunrise. Her confused thoughts ran hither
and thither; she found herself repeating something
that she and Mr. Hammerton had learned together
years ago,
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Yes,’&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;answered&nbsp;&nbsp;you&nbsp;&nbsp;last&nbsp;&nbsp;night;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘No,’&nbsp;&nbsp;this&nbsp;&nbsp;morning,&nbsp;&nbsp;sir,&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;say;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colors&nbsp;&nbsp;seen&nbsp;&nbsp;by&nbsp;&nbsp;candlelight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do&nbsp;&nbsp;not&nbsp;&nbsp;look&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;same&nbsp;&nbsp;by&nbsp;&nbsp;day.”<br />
</p>
<p>
Mr. Hammerton said that he and the Wadsworth
girls had learned “miles” of poetry together. The
Harrisons were not at church. When had such
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>
a thing happened before? Her fingers were on
the note in her pocket as she passed down the
aisle.
</p>
<p>
“Tessa, Tessa,” whispered a loud whisper behind
her, and Sue’s irrepressible lips were close to her
ear; “come home to dinner with me; you won’t
want to go to Bible class, for Miss Jewett is down
to Harrison’s. Father sent for her to go early this
morning.”
</p>
<p>
“Why is she there?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, somebody is sick. Felix. Dr. Lake was
there in the night and father was going this morning.
He was taken crazy, I believe. Come home
with me, will you?”
</p>
<p>
“Very well.”
</p>
<p>
She found Dine waiting for Norah, and told her
that she was going home with Sue, then rejoined
Sue at one of the gates.
</p>
<p>
“I’m awful lonesome Sundays,” began Sue; “Aunt
Jane has gone, I told you, didn’t I? A cousin of
hers died and left some dozens of young ones and
she had to go and take care of them and console
the widower. ‘The unconsolable widder of Deacon
Bedott will never get married again!’ but she went
all the same. She said that she had brought <em>me</em> up
far enough to take care of father.”
</p>
<p>
Sue’s lightness grated all along her nerves.
</p>
<p>
“Did you like Mary Sherwood’s hat? Too many
flowers, don’t you think so? And she <em>will</em> wear
light blue with her sallow face! Wasn’t it a queer
sermon, too? Don’t you think it is wicked for ministers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>
to frighten people so? He said that we make
our own lives, that we choose every day, and that
every choice has an influence. You think that I
don’t listen because I stare around, don’t you? I
sha’n’t forget that ever, because I have just had
a choice that will influence my life; and I chose
<em>not</em> to do it. It’s hateful to have Miss Jewett
away; I won’t go to Bible class, and I won’t let
you, either. I have a book to read, or I can go
to sleep.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, you can go to sleep.”
</p>
<p>
“I have something to tell you,” said Sue, shyly,
hesitating as she glanced into Tessa’s quiet, almost
stern, face.
</p>
<p>
“Not now—in the street.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no, when we are by ourselves. Our parlors
are lovely now; you will see how I have fixed
up things. Father is so delighted to have me home
that he will let me do any thing I like.”
</p>
<p>
Voices behind them and voices before them, now
and then a soft, Sunday laugh; through the pauses
of Sue’s talk Tessa listened, catching at any thing
to keep herself from thinking.
</p>
<p>
“A rare sermon.”
</p>
<p>
“It will do me good all the week.”
</p>
<p>
“The most becoming spring hat I’ve seen.”
</p>
<p>
“He is very handsome in the pulpit.”
</p>
<p>
“Come over to tea.”
</p>
<p>
“I expect to do great things this summer.”
</p>
<p>
“If I could talk like that I’d set people to
thinking.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>
</p>
<p>
“We sha’n’t get out of trouble in <em>this</em> world.”
</p>
<p>
“When I can’t forgive myself, I just let go of
myself, and let God forgive me.”
</p>
<p>
She wished that she could see that face; the
voice sounded familiar, the reply was in a man’s
voice; she felt as if she were listening, but she
would have liked to hear the reply, all the more
when she discovered that the talkers were Mr.
Lewis Gesner and his sister.
</p>
<p>
“<em>Isn’t</em> she handsomely dressed?” exclaimed Sue
in admiration. “She passed me without seeing me.
He is so wrapped up in that sister that he will
never be married.”
</p>
<p>
The crowd became thinner; couples and threes
and fours, sometimes only one, entered at each
gate as they moved on; they passed down the
long street almost alone; Dr. Greyson’s new house
stood nearly a mile from the Park; there was a
grass plot in front and stables in the rear.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Lake was driving around to the stables.
</p>
<p>
“I hoped that he wouldn’t be home to lunch;
he’s awful cross,” said Sue, with a pout and a flush.
Fifteen minutes later the lunch bell rang; Dr. Greyson
hurried in as they were seating themselves at
the table.
</p>
<p>
Tessa’s quickened heart-beats would not allow
her to ask about Felix; she knew that her voice
would betray her agitation; Dr. Lake had shaken
hands and had not stopped to speak to her; his
miserable face was but a repetition of yesterday.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Greyson seldom talked of anything but his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>
patients and he was interested in Felix Harrison,
she knew that she had but to wait patiently.
</p>
<p>
“Susie is a perfect housekeeper, isn’t she? Somebody
will find it out, I’m afraid.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s all I am,” said Sue. “Father, why didn’t
you educate me?”
</p>
<p>
“Educate a kitten!”
</p>
<p>
“How is Felix Harrison?” inquired Dr. Lake.
</p>
<p>
“Bad! Bad enough. That fellow has been walking
around with a brain fever. He’ll pull through
with care. Miss Jewett will stay until they can
get a nurse; I would rather keep <em>her</em>, though. I
warned him months ago. I told him that it would
come to this. He has thrown away his life; he’ll
never be good for any thing again. I am glad
that he has a father to take care of him; lucky for
him, and not so lucky for his father. I wouldn’t
care to see my son such a wreck as he’ll be. Why
a man born with brains will deliberately make a
fool of himself, I can’t understand. Teaching and
studying law and what not? He will have fits as
long as he lives coming upon him any day any
hour; he will be as much care as an infant. More,
for an infant does grow up, and he will only become
weaker and weaker mentally and physically.
He has been under some great excitement, I suspect.
<em>They</em> don’t know what it is. He came home
late last night; his father heard a noise in his room
and went in to find him as crazy as a loon. He
said that he had heard him talking in his sleep all
night long for two or three nights. I hope that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>
he isn’t engaged. I know a case like his, and that
poor fellow <em>was</em> engaged.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course that ended it,” said Sue. “A sick
husband of all things. I would drown myself, if I
had a sick husband.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course it ended it. It almost broke her
heart, though; broke it for a year, and then a
dashing cousin of his mended it.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps Felix hasn’t any cousin. Dr. Lake,
will you have more coffee?” Sue spoke carelessly,
not meeting his glance.
</p>
<p>
“Thank you, no.”
</p>
<p>
Dr. Greyson ran on talking and eating: “I told
the old man the whole truth; he begged so hard to
know the worst. He cried like a baby. He was
proud of Felix. Felix was a fine fellow,—a noble
fellow. But he’s dead now; dead, <em>and</em> buried.”
</p>
<p>
“Does Laura know?” inquired Sue, helping herself
to sweet pickled peaches. Tessa was tasting
the peaches, her throat so full of sobs that she
swallowed the fruit with pain.
</p>
<p>
“No, of course not. I told Miss Jewett to tell
her any thing, but be sure to keep her up. He
won’t die. Why should he? It will come gradually
to her. The very saddest case I know. And
to think that it might have been avoided. I didn’t
tell his father <em>that</em>, though. Felix has no one but
himself to thank. I warned him a year ago. Brains
<em>without</em> common sense is a very poor commodity.
What did the minister tell you Miss Tessa? I
haven’t been to church since Sue was a baby.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>
</p>
<p>
“No wonder that I’m a heathen, then; any body
would be with such a father,” retorted Sue.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Lake excused himself abruptly, and crossing
the hall went into the office.
</p>
<p>
“That foolish boy has taught me a lesson. I
would take a vacation this summer, only if I leave
Sue at home she would run off and marry Lake before
a week.”
</p>
<p>
“You needn’t be afraid,” answered Sue, scornfully.
“I look higher than Gerald Lake.”
</p>
<p>
The office door stood ajar. Sue colored with
vexation as the words in her high voice left her
lips.
</p>
<p>
“Shall we go into the parlor?” she said rising.
“You can find a book and I’ll go to sleep.”
</p>
<p>
The parlors had been refurnished in crimson and
brown. Standing in the centre of the front parlor,
Tessa exclaimed, “Oh, how pretty!”
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t it? All my taste. Dr. Lake did advise
me, though; he went with me. Now, you shall sit
in the front or back just as you please, in the most
comfortable of chairs, and I will sit opposite you
and snooze,—that is,” rather doubtfully, for she
was afraid of Tessa, “unless you will let me tell
you my secret.”
</p>
<p>
In passing through the rooms, Tessa had taken
a volume of Josephus from a table; she settled herself
at one of the back windows in a pretty crimson
and brown chair, smoothed the folds of her black
dress, folded her hands in her lap over the green
volume, and looked up at Sue. Sue and a book in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>
brown paper were in another crimson and brown
chair at another window; flushed and vexed she
played with the edges of her book.
</p>
<p>
“Do you think that he heard what I said?” she
asked anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“You know as well as I.”
</p>
<p>
She did not feel in a gentle mood towards Sue;
her voice and words had rasped her nerves for the
last hour.
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t intend it for him,” she was half crying,
“but father provoked me. He does bother me so.
I didn’t flirt with him, I was real good and sisterly.
I told him to call me Sister Sue. But after it all,
he asked me to marry him, and was as mad as a
hornet, and said dreadful things to me when I refused
him.”
</p>
<p>
She nibbled the edge of her book; Tessa had
nothing to say.
</p>
<p>
“I couldn’t help it now, could I?” in a tearful
voice.
</p>
<p>
“You know best.”
</p>
<p>
“I <em>know</em> I couldn’t. I like him. I can’t help
liking him; a cat or a dog would like him. In
some things, I like him better than Stacey, and I’m
sure I like him better than old John Gesner.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa opened her book and looked into the handsome
face of Flavius Josephus.
</p>
<p>
“Haven’t you any thing to say to me?”
</p>
<p>
“No.”
</p>
<p>
“You might sympathize with me.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know how.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>
</p>
<p>
Sue nibbled the edge of her book, with her eyes
filled with tears. She had no friend except Tessa,
and now she had deserted her!
</p>
<p>
Tessa turned the leaves and thought that she
was reading; she did read the words: “The family
from which I am derived is not an ignoble one,
but hath descended all along from the priests; and
as nobility among several people is of a different
origin, so with us to be of the sacerdotal dignity is
an indication of the splendor of a family.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” she tried to think, her eyes wandering
out of the window towards the rear of Gesner’s
Row, “and that is why the promise, to be made
kings and priests—”
</p>
<p>
“Tessa, I think you are real mean,” said Sue, in
a pathetic voice.
</p>
<p>
Tessa met her eyes and smiled. She did not like
to be hard towards Sue.
</p>
<p>
“Do you think that I’ve been so wicked?”
</p>
<p>
“I think that you have been so wicked that you
must either be forgiven or punished.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear! Oh, dear <em>me</em>,” dropping her head on
the arm of her chair.
</p>
<p>
Tessa turned another leaf. “Moreover when I
was a child and about fourteen years of age, I was
commended by all for the love I had to learning;
on which account the high priests and principal
men of the city came then frequently to me together,
in order to know my opinion about the
accurate understanding of points of the law.”
</p>
<p>
Her eyes wandered away from the book and out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
the open window towards the rows of open windows
in the houses behind the stables. At one
window was seated an old man reading; in the
same room, for he raised his head to speak to her,
at another window, a woman was sitting reading
also. She was glad that there were two. She wondered
if they had been kind to each other as long
as they had known each other. If the old man
should die to-night would the old woman have
need to say, “Forgive me.” Through the windows
above came the heavy, steady whirr of a sewing-machine,
with now and then a <em>click</em>, as if the long
seam had come to its end; the bushy, black head of
a German Jew was bent over it; the face that he
raised was not at all like that of the refined Flavius
Josephus. No one ever went to him with knotty
points in the law! There were plants in the other
window of the room; she was glad of the plants.
It was rather mournful to be seeking things to be
glad about. A child was crying, sharply, rebelliously;
a woman’s sharper voice was breaking in
upon it.
</p>
<p>
There was a voice in the stable speaking to a
horse, “Quiet, old boy.” A horse was brought out
and harnessed to a buggy without a top. Dr.
Greyson climbed into the buggy and drove off.
Another horse was brought out and harnessed to
a buggy with a top. She persuaded herself that
she was very much interested in watching people
and things; she had not had time to think of Felix
yet. Dr. Lake came out, sprang into the buggy,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>
and drove slowly out, not looking towards the
windows where sat the two figures, each apparently
absorbed in a book.
</p>
<p>
“Tessa,” in a broken voice, like the appeal of
a naughty child with the naughtiness all gone,
“what shall I do?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” said Tessa.
</p>
<p>
“You don’t think that I ought to marry him.
He smells of medicine so.”
</p>
<p>
“I do not think any thing. If I did think
any thing, it would be my thinking and not
yours.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you believe that he cares so <em>very</em> much?”
</p>
<p>
The exultant undertone was too much for Tessa’s
patience.
</p>
<p>
“I hope that he has too much good sense to care
long; some day when he can see how heartless you
are, he will despise himself for having fancied that
he loved you.”
</p>
<p>
“You don’t care how you hurt my feelings.”
</p>
<p>
“I am not sure that you have any to be hurt.”
</p>
<p>
“You are a mean thing; I don’t like you; I wish
that I hadn’t asked you to come.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa’s eyes were on <em>Josephus</em> again.
</p>
<p>
After a long, silent hour, during which Sue looked
out the window, and nibbled the edge of her book,
and during which Tessa thought of every body and
every thing except Felix Harrison, Sue spoke: “I’m
going up-stairs for a while; excuse me, please.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa nodded, closed her book and leaned back
in the pretty crimson and brown chair. Sue came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
to her and stood a moment; her heart <em>was</em> sore.
If Tessa would only say something kind! But
Tessa would not; she only said coolly, “Well?”
</p>
<p>
“You don’t believe that I am sorry.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t believe any thing about it, but that you
are heartless and wicked.”
</p>
<p>
Sue stood waiting for another word, but Tessa
looked tired, and as if she had forgotten her presence.
Why should she look so, Sue asked herself
resentfully; <em>she</em> had nothing to trouble her?
Sue went away, her arms dropped at her side, her
long green dress trailing on the carpet; tenderness
gathered in Tessa’s eyes as the green figure
disappeared. “I don’t like to be hard to her,” she
murmured.
</p>
<p>
The terrible thought of Felix pressed heavier and
heavier. She took the note from her pocket and
pondered each word; the cruel, truthful words! If
he had read them she might have had to believe
all her life that she had hastened this illness! The
sunshine grew warmer, beating down upon the
paving stones in the yard, the faces kept their
places in the windows, the child’s shrill, rebellious
cry burst out again and the woman’s sharper
voice.
</p>
<p>
Sue’s steps were moving overhead; suddenly, so
suddenly as to break in upon the current of her
thoughts, Sue’s voice rang out in her clear soprano,
“Rock of Ages, cleft for me.”
</p>
<p>
The voice grated, the words coming from the
thoughtless lips grated on her ear and on her heart,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
grated more harshly than the woman’s sharp voice
in taunting rebuke.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;in&nbsp;&nbsp;my&nbsp;&nbsp;hand&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;bring,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy&nbsp;&nbsp;cross&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;cling.”<br />
</p>
<p>
As soon as she had decided that she could not
bear it another instant, the singing ceased. It
ceased and left her in tears.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span><a name='ch10' id='ch10'></a>X.—FORGETTING THE BREAD.</h2>
<p>
Again Tessa was spending the night with Miss
Jewett; Sue Greyson had chatted away half the
evening, and it was nearly eleven before Tessa
could put both arms around her friend and squeeze
her.
</p>
<p>
“I am hungry for a talk with you, you dear little
woman, every thing is getting to be criss-cross with
me nowadays; I’m so troubled and so wicked that
I almost want to die. You wouldn’t love me any
more if you could know how false I am. All my
life I have been so proud of being true,” she added
bitterly, “I despise myself.”
</p>
<p>
“Is that all?”
</p>
<p>
Miss Jewett was leaning back in her little rocker.
Almost before she knew it herself, Tessa had
dropped upon the carpet at her feet.
</p>
<p>
“I have come to learn of you, my saint.”
</p>
<p>
“What have you come to learn, my sinner?”
</p>
<p>
“I’m confused—I’m bewildered—I’m all in a tangle.
People say, ‘pray about it’; you say that yourself;
and I do pray about all the trials in my life and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
yet—I can not understand—I am groping my way,
I am blind, walking in the dark. Do you know that
I believe that praying for a thing is the hardest
way in the world to get it? I would rather earn
it a thousand times over; I know that you think
me dreadfully wicked, but do not stop me, let me
pour it all out; hard praying, never ceasing, night
and day, is enough to wear one out soul and body,
because you <em>must</em> expect to get what you ask for,
and if you do not after praying so long the disappointment
is heart-breaking. There now! I have
said it and I feel better. I have no one except you
to talk to and I wouldn’t dare tell you how wicked
I am. About something I have prayed with all my
strength—I will not be ashamed to tell you—I
know you will understand; it is about loving somebody.
I have been so ashamed and shocked at
girls’ love-stories and I wanted one so true and
pure and unselfish and beautiful, and I have prayed
that mine might be that, and I have tried so hard
to make it that, and yet I get into trouble and
break my own heart, which is nothing at all, and
more than break some one else’s heart and do as
much harm as Sue Greyson does, who is as flighty
as a witch! I would rather go without things
than pray years and years and be disappointed
every day, or go farther and farther into wrong-doing
as I do; I don’t believe that the flightiest and
flirtiest of your girls does as much harm as I do, or
is as false to herself as I am! And I have been so
proud of being true!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>
</p>
<p>
“My <em>dear</em> child.”
</p>
<p>
“Is that all you can say to comfort me?”
</p>
<p>
“Why do you pray?”
</p>
<p>
“Why do I pray?” repeated Tessa in surprise.
“To get what I want, I suppose.”
</p>
<p>
“I thought so.”
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t that what you pray for?”
</p>
<p>
“Hardly. I pray that I may get what God
wants.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh,” said Tessa with a half startled, little cry.
</p>
<p>
“I fear that you are having a hard time over
something, child.”
</p>
<p>
“If you only knew—but you wouldn’t believe in
me any longer; neither would father, or Dine, or
Gus, or any one who trusts me; I will not tell you;
I have lost all faith in myself.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank God for that!” exclaimed the little
woman brightly.
</p>
<p>
“I am too sore and bruised to be thankful; I feel,
sometimes, as if I could creep into a dark corner
and cry my heart out. I could bear it if I were
the only one, but to think that I must make somebody’s
heart ache as mine does! I thought all my
prayers would prevail to keep me from making
mistakes.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps you have been trying to <em>earn</em> your
heart’s desire by heaping up prayers, piling them
up higher and higher, morning, noon, and night,
and you have held them up to God thinking that
He must be glad to take them; I shouldn’t wonder
if you had even supposed that you were paying
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
Him overmuch—you had prayed enough to get
what you want some time ago.”
</p>
<p>
“That is true,” answered Tessa, emphatically.
“I have felt as if He were wronging me by taking
my prayers and giving me so little in return.
I believe that I have thought my prayers
precious enough to pay for any thing. I paid my
prayers, and I am disappointed that I have not my
purchases.”
</p>
<p>
“Then your faith has been all in your <em>prayers</em>.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; I was sure that I could not go wrong because
I prayed so much.”
</p>
<p>
“And your faith has been in your <em>faith</em>.”
</p>
<p>
“And neither my faith nor my prayers have kept
me from being false. Oh, it has been such hard
work!”
</p>
<p>
Tessa’s face was drawn as if by physical pain.
</p>
<p>
“I was thinking in the night last night that I did
not believe that Hannah, or Elizabeth, or Huldah, or
Persis, or Dorcas ever prayed more fervently or unceasingly
than I have; I have builded on my <em>faith</em>,
no wonder that the first rough wind has shaken
my foundation! Ever since Felix Harrison years
ago called me a flirt, I have prayed that I might
be true; and to-night I am as false as Sue Greyson.”
</p>
<p>
“Through an experience once, long ago, I learned
to pray that the will of God might be done in me,
even although I must be sifted as wheat.”
</p>
<p>
“I am not brave enough for that. Oh, Miss
Jewett, I am afraid that God is angry with me;
and I have meant to be so true.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
</p>
<p>
“Do you remember the time that the disciples
forgot to take bread?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, but that is not like me.”
</p>
<p>
“I think it is—just like you.”
</p>
<p>
“Then tell me.”
</p>
<p>
“It was one time when Jesus and the disciples
were alone on board the ship; He had been deeply
grieved with the Pharisees, sighing in His spirit
over them, for they had tempted Him with asking
of Him a sign from heaven. A sign from heaven!
And He had just filled four thousand hungry people
with seven loaves and a few small fishes!
</p>
<p>
“By and by He began to talk to the disciples;
speaking with authority, perhaps, it even sounded
severe to them as He charged them to beware of
the leaven of the Pharisees.
</p>
<p>
“Then they began to talk among themselves:
what had they done to be thus bidden to beware
of the leaven of the Pharisees? <em>Leaven</em> reminded
them of bread! Oh, now they knew! They had
but one loaf in the ship; they had forgotten to
bring bread with them; perhaps the Lord was
hungry and knew that they had not enough for
Him and for themselves. It may be that He overheard
them reasoning among themselves, or perhaps,
forward Peter asked Him if He were rebuking
them for forgetting the bread; for as soon as
He knew what was troubling their simple hearts,
how He talked to them! Seven questions, one
after another, He asked them, ending with: <em>How
is it</em> that ye do not understand?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>
</p>
<p>
“And you are like them, child. The Lord has
suffered you to be led into trouble that He may
teach you something about Himself and you fall
down at His feet bemoaning yourself; you forget
Him and the great lessons He has to teach you
and think only of yourself and some little thing
that you missed doing; you missed it, blinded with
tears in your eagerness to do right, you <em>meant</em> to
be so good and true, and because you made a mistake
in your blindness and eagerness, you think
Him such a harsh, unloving Father that all He
cares to do is to punish you! Trust Him, Tessa!
Don’t moan over a loaf of bread forgotten before
Him who has love enough, and power enough to
give you and somebody beside a thousand thousand
loaves. Do not grieve Him by crying out
any longer, ‘Do not punish me; I <em>meant</em> to be so
good?’”
</p>
<p>
Tessa’s head kept its position. When she raised
it, after a long silence, she said: “I will not think so
any more; you don’t know what I suffered in thinking
that He is punishing me.”
</p>
<p>
“‘How is it that ye do not understand?’”
</p>
<p>
“Because I think about my own troubles and
not of what He is teaching me,” said Tessa humbly.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span><a name='ch11' id='ch11'></a>XI.—ON THE HIGHWAY.</h2>
<p>
In June, Tessa gathered roses for Miss Jewett,
and every evening filled the tall glass vase with
white roses for the tea-table; in June, Dunellen
Institute closed for the season and Dinah was graduated;
henceforth she would be a young lady of
leisure, or a young lady seeking a vocation. In
June, Mrs. Wadsworth scolded Tessa for “taking
it so coolly about the dreadful thing that had come
upon young Harrison.”
</p>
<p>
“How many times have you called to see Laura
since her poor brother has been so poorly?”
</p>
<p>
“I have called every two days,” answered Tessa
in her quietest tones.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you have! Why didn’t you say so? You
are so still that people think you do nothing but
pick roses. Anxious as I am, you might have told
me how he was getting on. How was he yesterday?”
</p>
<p>
“Comfortable.”
</p>
<p>
“Did you see him?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>
</p>
<p>
“Was he sitting up?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, he had been sitting up half an hour.”
</p>
<p>
“How does he look?”
</p>
<p>
“His eyes are deep in his head, his voice is
as weak as a child’s, he burst into tears because
Laura did not come when he touched his bell for
her.”
</p>
<p>
“Was he cheerful?”
</p>
<p>
“He smiled and talked.”
</p>
<p>
“Are you going to-day?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; Dr. Lake will call for me about five.”
</p>
<p>
“You and Dr. Lake are getting to be great
friends.”
</p>
<p>
“Are we?”
</p>
<p>
“Do you know what he says about Felix?”
</p>
<p>
“He can say nothing but that he may never be
himself again.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, he did; but you mustn’t repeat it; promise
me.”
</p>
<p>
“There is no need for me to promise.”
</p>
<p>
“He said that his mind will grow weaker and
weaker. Do you know that he has been having <em>fits</em>
for two years?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I am aware of it.”
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t it a dreadful, horrible thing? But he always
was a little wild and queer, not quite like
other folks. I was sure that he would die; he may
yet, he may have a relapse. I should think that
they would rather have him dead than grow silly.
I suppose that Laura will never be married now;
he will never be fit to be left alone. His father can
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
marry though, and that would leave her free. I
never object to second marriages, do you?”
</p>
<p>
“That depends upon several things.”
</p>
<p>
“My father was married three times. I had two
stepmothers, and might have had four if he had
lived longer. Some people think, but I never did,
that an engagement is as good as a marriage, do
you?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course, I knew that you would think so.
But I never had any high-flown ideas about engagements.
I was engaged to John Gesner—your
father doesn’t know it to this day—he has high and
mighty ideas about things like you. <em>You</em> ought to
have some feeling about Felix Harrison, then, for
he always wanted you. Professional men are always
poor; Dr. Lake is not much of a ‘catch.’”
</p>
<p>
“I think he is—or will be—to the woman who
can appreciate him.”
</p>
<p>
“I beseech you don’t you go to appreciate him.”
</p>
<p>
“I do now—sufficiently,” she answered, smiling.
</p>
<p>
Two weeks later, having seen Felix several times
during the interval, Dine brought her a letter late
in the afternoon.
</p>
<p>
Felix always had written her name in full, saying
that it was prettier than the one that she had
given herself in baby-days; the penmanship appeared
like a child’s imitation of his bold strokes.
</p>
<p>
Not daring and not caring to open it immediately,
she put on her hat and went out to walk far
past the end of the planks down into the green
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
country. She thought that she knew every tree
and every field all the long way to the Harrison
Homestead.
</p>
<p>
Opening the letter at last, she read:
</p>
<p>
“<span class='sc'>My Friend</span>,—I suppose you know all the truth.
I wrung it out of Dr. Greyson to-day after you left
me. You may have known it all the time. Father
has known it, but not Laura. I shall never be
what I once was; I know it better than any physician
can tell me. If I live to forget every thing
else (and I may), I think that I shall never forget
that night. But I shall not let my mind go without
a struggle; I shall read, I shall write, I shall
travel, when I am able. I have been reading Macaulay
to-day. I shall be a burden to father and
Laura, and to any who may nurse me for wages.
But I shall not be a burden to you. I know that
you meant that <em>you</em> would never break our covenant,
when you said: ‘Promises are made to be
kept,’ but <em>I</em> will break it. I am breaking it now.
You did belong to me when you last said good-by
and laid your young, strong hand over my poor
fingers; but you do not belong to me as you read
this. As I can not know the exact moment when
you read it, I can never know when you cease to
belong to me. Laura and father intend to take me
away; do not come to me until I return. No one
knows. In all my ravings, I never spoke your
name; it was on my mind that I had promised not
to speak of it, and I never once forgot. But your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>
presence was in every wild and horrible dream;
you were being scalped and drowned and burned
alive, and often and often you sat beside me holding
my hand; many many times you came to me
and said, ‘I will keep my word,’ but something
took you away; you never went of your own accord.
I have asked them all what I raved about
and every name that I spoke, but no one has answered
‘Tessa.’ Write to me this once, and never
again, and tell me that you agree, that you are
willing to break the bond that held us together
such a little while. I am a man, and a selfish one
at that, therefore I rejoice that you <em>were</em> mine.
You can have but one answer to give. I will not
accept any devotion from you that may hinder your
becoming the happy wife of a good man. Do not
be too sorry for me. Laura will expect you to
write to her, but I pray you, do not write; I should
look for your letters and they would take away
the little fortitude I have. Be a good girl; love
somebody by and by. You have burned a great
many letters that I have written. This is the last.”
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“F.&nbsp;&nbsp;W.&nbsp;&nbsp;H.”<br />
</p>
<p>
Again and again she read it, pausing over each
simple, full utterance. He could never say to her
again, “You have spoiled my life.” She had done
her best to atone for the sorrow that she had so unwittingly
caused him, and it had not been accepted
by Him who had planned all her life. There was
nothing more for her to do. The letter was like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>
him. She remembered his kindly, gracious ways;
his eagerness to be kind to her, how he would sit
or stand near her to watch her as she talked or
worked; how timidly he would touch her dress or
her hand; how his face would change if she chanced
to look up at him; how his pale green eyes would
glitter when she preferred the society of Gus Hammerton
or any other of the Dunellen boys, ever so
long ago, as they were boys and girls together; almost
as long ago as when she was a little girl and
he a big boy and he would bring her fruit and
flowers! On their Saturday excursions after nuts
or berries or wild flowers, how he would fall behind
the others when she did and catch her hand
if they heard a noise in the woods or lost themselves
for half a minute among a new clump of
trees.
</p>
<p>
In the long, happy weeks that she had passed at
the Homestead, in the days when his mother was
alive, how thoughtful he had been of her comfort,
how he had tried to please her in work or play!
One evening after they had all been sitting together
on the porch and telling stories, she had
heard his mother say to his father: “Tessa has
great influence over Felix, I hope that she will
marry him.”
</p>
<p>
“I won’t,” her rebellious little heart had replied.
And at bedtime she had told Laura that she meant
to marry a beautiful young man with dark eyes
who must know every thing and wear a cloak.
“And Felix has light eyes,” she had added.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
</p>
<p>
She laughed and then sighed over the foolish, innocent
days when girlhood and womanhood had
meant only wonderful good times like the good
times in fairy tales and Bible stories.
</p>
<p>
Then for the last time she read his letter and tore
it into morsels, scattering them hither and thither
as she walked.
</p>
<p>
She had done all she could do; he could not keep
hold of her hand any longer.
</p>
<p>
The last bit of paper fluttered on the air; she gave
a long look towards the dear old Homestead; she
could see the spires of the two churches at Mayfield,
the brass rooster on the school-house where
Felix had taught, and then she turned homeward
to write the letter that would release him from the
covenant whose keeping had been made impossible
to them. As she turned, the noise of wheels
was before her, the dust of travel in her face; she
lifted her eyes in time to return a bow from Ralph
Towne and to feel the smile that lighted the face
of the white-haired lady at his side.
</p>
<p>
In the dusk she came down-stairs, dressed for a
walk, with several letters in her hand.
</p>
<p>
“Whither does fancy lead you, daughter?” her
father asked as she was passing through the sitting-room.
He was lying upon the lounge with a
heavy shawl thrown over him; his voice came quick
and sharp as though he were in pain.
</p>
<p>
She moved towards him instantly. “Why, father,
are you sick?”
</p>
<p>
“No, dear, not—now,” catching his breath. “I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>
have been in pain and it has worn upon me. Greyson
gave me something to carry with me some time
ago, I have taken it three times to-day and now I
shall go to sleep?”
</p>
<p>
“Are you <em>sure</em> you feel better?” she asked caressing
the hand that he held out to her. “Let me
stay and do something for you.”
</p>
<p>
“No. I must go to sleep. Run along. I have
sent your mother away, and now I send you away.”
</p>
<p>
She lingered a moment, stooping to kiss the bald
forehead and then the plump hand.
</p>
<p>
Her father was very happy to-night, for her
mother, of her own accord, for the first time in fifteen
years, had kissed him.
</p>
<p>
He held Tessa’s hand thinking that he would tell
her, then he decided that the thought of those fifteen
years would hurt her too sorely.
</p>
<p>
“I thought that you meant to tell me something,”
she said.
</p>
<p>
“No; run along.”
</p>
<p>
Along the planks, along the pavement, across
the Park, she walked slowly, in the summer starlight,
with the letters in her hand.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Star&nbsp;&nbsp;light!&nbsp;&nbsp;Star&nbsp;&nbsp;bright!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;wish&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;may,&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;wish&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;might,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See&nbsp;&nbsp;somebody&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;want&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;see&nbsp;&nbsp;to-night.”<br />
</p>
<p>
A child’s voice was chanting the words in a
dreamy recitative.
</p>
<p>
“Dear child,” sighed Tessa, with her five and
twenty years tugging at her heart.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>
</p>
<p>
She longed for a sight of Miss Jewett’s untroubled
face to-night; if she might only tell her about
the right thing that she had tried to do and how the
power to do it had been taken from her!
</p>
<p>
But no one could comfort her concerning it; not
her father, not Miss Jewett, not Ralph Towne, not
Gus Hammerton, not Felix!
</p>
<p>
One glance up into the sky over the trees in the
Park helped her more than any human comforting.
It was a new experience to have outgrown human
comforting; she thought that she had outgrown it
that day—the last day of the year; still she must
see Miss Jewett; it would be a rest to hear some
one talk who did not know about Felix or that
other time that the sunshiny eyes had brought to
life again. Would they meet as heretofore? Must
they meet socially upon the street or at church?
</p>
<p>
If it might have been that he might remain away
for years and years—until she had wholly forgotten
or did not care!
</p>
<p>
Miss Jewett was almost alone; there was no one
with her but Sue Greyson tossing over neckties to
find a white one with fringe.
</p>
<p>
Through the silks there shone on the first finger
of Sue’s left hand the sparkle of a diamond; she
colored and smiled, then laughed and held her finger
up for Tessa’s inspection.
</p>
<p>
“Guess who gave it to me,” she said defiantly.
</p>
<p>
It could not be Dr. Lake—Tessa would not speak
his name; it must be her father—but no, Sue would
not blush as she was blushing now; it could not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>
be Mr. Gesner! Tessa’s heart quickened, she was
angry with herself for thinking of Mr. Gesner. Mr.
Towne! But that was not possible.
</p>
<p>
“Can’t you guess?” Sue was enjoying her confusion.
</p>
<p>
“No. I can’t guess.”
</p>
<p>
“Say the Man in the Moon. I as much expected
it. It’s from Stacey! I knew you would be confounded.
Wasn’t I sly about it? We are to be
married the first day of October. We settled on
that because it is Stacey’s birthday! It is Dr.
Lake’s too. Isn’t it comical. Stacey is twenty-three
and the doctor is twenty-nine! Stacey is a
year younger than I. I wish that he wasn’t. I
think that I shall change my age in the Bible.
When I told Dr. Lake, he said that I seemed inclined
to change some other things in the Bible.
Don’t you tell, either of you. It’s a profound secret.
Wasn’t father hopping, though? But I told
him that I would elope if he didn’t consent like a
good papa; and now since Stacey’s salary is raised
he hasn’t a bit of an excuse for being ugly about
it. I am going to have all the new furniture, too;
I bargained for that. Won’t it be queer for me to
live so far away? Stacey is in a lace house in Philadelphia,
don’t you remember? You ought to see
the white lace sacque that he brought me for an
engagement present; it’s too lovely for any thing.
Why, Tessa, you look stunned, are you speechless?
Don’t you relish the idea of my being married before
you? You ought to have seen Dr. Lake when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
I showed my ring to him! He turned as white as
a sheet and trembled so that he had to sit down;
all he said was, ‘May God forgive you.’ Don’t you
think that it was wicked in him to say that? I
told him that it sounded like swearing. Yes, I’ll
take this one, please. And, oh, Tessa, I want you
to help me to buy things. I am to have a dozen of
every thing. I shall be married in white silk; I told
father that he would never have another daughter
married so that he might as well open his long
purse. We shall go to the White Mountains on our
wedding tour. It’s late in the season, of course,
but I always wanted to go to the White Mountains
and I will if we are both frozen to death. I
know that you are angry with me, but I can’t help
it. You are just the one to believe in love. I have
always liked Stacey; he has just beautiful hands,
and his manners are really touching. You ought
to see him lift his hat; Mr. Towne is nowhere.”
</p>
<p>
“What will your father do?” asked Miss Jewett.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Aunt Jane must come back, she hasn’t captivated
the widower yet; or he might get married
himself. I think that I’ll suggest it. <em>Wouldn’t</em> it
be fun to have a double wedding? I’ll let father
be married first; Stacey and I will stand up with
them.”
</p>
<p>
Sue went off into a long, loud peal of laughter;
Miss Jewett smiled; Tessa spoke gravely: “Sue,
your mother would not like to hear that.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, bother! She doesn’t think of me. I want
some silks, too, please. I shall have to make Stacey
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
a pair of slippers and a lot of other pretty things.
And oh, Tessa, I haven’t told you the news! The
queerest thing! Dr. Towne—we must call him
that now—has bought that handsome brick house
opposite the Park and is going into practice. Dr.
Lake says that of course people will run after <em>him</em>
while they would let him starve!”
</p>
<p>
“Then he’ll smell of medicine, too,” Tessa could
not forbear suggesting.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and have bottles in all his pockets. I’m
going to see your mother; she cares more about
dress than you and Dine put together. If your
father should die, she would be married before
either of you. I won’t come if you look so cross
at me.”
</p>
<p>
At that moment Mr. Hammerton pushed open
the door; he had come for gloves and handkerchiefs.
Tessa selected them for him and would
then have waited for her word with Miss Jewett,
had not one of the clerks returned from supper.
</p>
<p>
“Come, Lady Blue, I am going your way.”
</p>
<p>
“Father is not well to-night; he will not play
chess.”
</p>
<p>
“I am going all the same, however; you shall
play with me, and Dine shall read the ‘Nut Brown
Maid.’”
</p>
<p>
As they were crossing the Park, they met Dr.
Lake; he was walking hurriedly; she could not see
his face.
</p>
<p>
“What do you think Lake said to me last night?
We were talking—rather, he was—about trouble.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
He has seen a good deal of it one time and another
I imagine; his nerves are so raw that every thing
hurts. For want of something to suit him in my
own experience, I quoted a thought of Charles
Kingsley’s. He turned upon me as if I had struck
him—‘A man in a book said that.’ A man in a
book <em>did</em> say it, so I had nothing to say. Something
is troubling you, what is it?”
</p>
<p>
“More than one something is troubling me. I
just heard a bit of news.”
</p>
<p>
“Not good news?”
</p>
<p>
“I can not see any good.”
</p>
<p>
He repeated in a hurried tone:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Good&nbsp;&nbsp;tidings&nbsp;&nbsp;every&nbsp;&nbsp;day;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God’s&nbsp;&nbsp;messengers&nbsp;&nbsp;ride&nbsp;&nbsp;fast.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We&nbsp;&nbsp;do&nbsp;&nbsp;not&nbsp;&nbsp;hear&nbsp;&nbsp;one&nbsp;&nbsp;half&nbsp;&nbsp;they&nbsp;&nbsp;say,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;such&nbsp;&nbsp;noise&nbsp;&nbsp;on&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;highway<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where&nbsp;&nbsp;we&nbsp;&nbsp;must&nbsp;&nbsp;wait&nbsp;&nbsp;while&nbsp;&nbsp;they&nbsp;&nbsp;ride&nbsp;&nbsp;past.’”<br />
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps I do not hear one half they say this
time; the half I do hear is troublesome enough.
Some day, when I may begin ‘five and fifty years
ago,’ I will tell you a story.”
</p>
<p>
“Will it take so long for me to become worthy
to hear it?”
</p>
<p>
“I wish I <em>might</em> tell you; you always help me,”
she said impulsively.
</p>
<p>
“Is there a hindrance?”
</p>
<p>
“It is too near to be spoken of.”
</p>
<p>
She was not in the mood for chess, but her
father brightened at Mr. Hammerton’s entrance,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>
arose, threw off the shawl, and came to the table,
saying that he would watch her moves. He seated
himself close to her, with an arm across the back
of her chair, once or twice bringing his head down
to the chestnut braids.
</p>
<p>
“How alike you are!” exclaimed Mr. Hammerton.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I am very pretty,” replied Mr. Wadsworth,
seriously.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Wadsworth had taken her work over to
Mrs. Bird for a consultation thereupon; Dine fell
asleep, resting her curly head on the book that
Mr. Hammerton had brought her.
</p>
<p>
When Mr. Hammerton arose, Mr. Wadsworth
went to the door with him to look out into the
night; Tessa said good night and went up-stairs;
the sleepy head upon the book did not stir.
</p>
<p>
“I never can find a constellation,” remarked Mr.
Wadsworth. “Tessa is always laughing at me.”
</p>
<p>
“Step out and see if I can help you.”
</p>
<p>
They moved to the end of the piazza leaving the
door wide open; the sleepy brown eyes opened with
a start—was she listening to words that she should
not hear?
</p>
<p>
Mr. Hammerton had surely said “Dinah.” And
now her father was saying—was she dreaming
still?—“Take her, and God bless you both. I
have nothing better to hope for my darling. She
will make you a good wife.”
</p>
<p>
“Let it remain a secret I want her to love me
without any urging. She must love me because I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
am necessary to her and not merely because I love
her.”
</p>
<p>
Could Tessa have heard his voice, she would
never again have accused him of coldness.
</p>
<p>
“I shall have to wait—I expect an increase of
salary. I am not sure that she thinks of me otherwise
than as a grown-up brother—but I will bide
my time. I know this—at least I think I do—that
she does not care for any one else.”
</p>
<p>
“I am sure of that,” said her father’s voice. “You
do not know how you have taken a burden from me,
my son! I have <em>hoped</em> for this.” Startled little Dinah
arose and fled.
</p>
<p>
She would never tell, no, not even Tessa; but how
could she behave towards him as if she did not
know?
</p>
<p>
“Tessa, did you ever have a secret to keep?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. Laura told me once that she had a gold
dollar and I’ve never told until this minute.”
</p>
<p>
“But this is a wonderful, beautiful, happy secret;
the wonderfulest and beautifulest thing in
the world. And I shall never, never tell. You
will never know until you discover it yourself.”
</p>
<p>
“I want to know something to be glad of.”
</p>
<p>
“You will be glad of this. As glad as glad
can be. It is rather funny that neither of us
ever guessed; and you are quick to see things,
too.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps I <em>do</em> know, pretty sister.”
</p>
<p>
“No, you don’t. I should have seen in your
manner. Perhaps I dreamed it; or perhaps an angel came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
and told me. It is good enough for an
angel to tell.”
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Good&nbsp;&nbsp;tidings&nbsp;&nbsp;every&nbsp;&nbsp;day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God’s&nbsp;&nbsp;messengers&nbsp;&nbsp;ride&nbsp;&nbsp;fast.’”<br />
</p>
<p>
repeated Tessa.
</p>
<p>
“Tessa,” with her face turned away, “do you like
Gus very much?”
</p>
<p>
“Do I like <em>you</em> very much? I should just as
soon think of your asking me that.”
</p>
<p>
“Better than Felix or Mr. Towne or Dr. Lake, or
any of the ten thousand young men in Dunellen?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, Dine, what ails you? Are you asking
my advice? He hasn’t been making love to my
little sister, has he?”
</p>
<p>
“No,” said Dinah, “I wonder if he knows how.
Daisy Grey’s father is dead. There will have to be
a new Greek professor at the Seminary. She liked
her father.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span><a name='ch12' id='ch12'></a>XII.—GOOD ENOUGH TO BE TRUE.</h2>
<p>
The afternoon sun was shining down hot on the
head of the soldier on his tall pedestal in the Park;
he stood leaning on his gun, his eyes intently
peering from under the broad visor of his cap; at
his feet a group of children were playing soldiers
marching to the war; at the pump, several yards
distant, a small boy was pumping for the others to
drink, a tall boy was lifting the rusty dipper to his
lips while a ragged little girl was wistfully awaiting
her turn; nurses in white caps were rolling infants’
chaises along the smooth, wide paths; ladies
in shopping attire were sauntering with brown parcels
in their hands; half-grown boys were lolling
on the green benches with cigars and lazy words
in their mouths; girls in twos and threes were strolling
along with linked arms mingling gay talk with
gay laughter; in the arbor seven little girls and
three little boys were playing school: a little boy
who stammered was trying to spell Con-stan-ti-no-ple,
a rosy child in white was noisily repeating
“Thirty days hath September,” a black-eyed boy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>
was shouting “The boy stood on the burning deck,”
and a naughty child was being vigorously scolded
by the teacher, who held a threatening willow
switch above her head. “You are the dreadfulest
child that ever breathed,” she was declaring.
“You are the essence of stupidity, you are the
dumbest of the dumb.”
</p>
<p>
A serious voice arrested the willow switch: “I
didn’t like to be scolded when I was a little girl, it
used to make me cry.”
</p>
<p>
The willow switch dropped; the various recitations
came to a sudden pause. “But she is such a
dreadful bad girl,” urged the teacher.
</p>
<p>
Tessa Wadsworth lingered with her reticule,
three parcels, a parasol, and <em>Sartor Resartus</em> in her
hands.
</p>
<p>
“<em>You</em> come and be teacher and tell us a story,”
coaxed the naughty child.
</p>
<p>
But Tessa laughed and moved on, to be stopped,
however, by a quick call. “Tessa Wadsworth! I
declare that you are a pedestrian.”
</p>
<p>
The voice belonged to a pair of blue eyes, and a
slight figure in drab.
</p>
<p>
“Well, now that you have caught me what will
you have?”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll be satisfied with a walk across the Park.
Didn’t you know that I was home? Gus said that
he would tell you.”
</p>
<p>
“Have you had a pleasant time?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I always manage to enjoy myself. How is
it that you always stay poking at home?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
</p>
<p>
“I seem to have found my niche at home. Every
one needs me.”
</p>
<p>
“Dunellen is a poky little place, but Nan thinks
it is splendid.”
</p>
<p>
“I expect to spend the winter away from home
and I don’t want to go. I don’t see why I must.
Mother has been promising for years that the first
winter that Dine was out of school I should go
for three months, more or less, to an old aunt of
hers for whom I was named; she has lost all her
seven boys and lives on a farm down in the country
with the dearest old husband that ever breathed.
If I had such a dear old husband I should always
want to be alone with him.”
</p>
<p>
“That sounds just like you. I wanted Naughty
Nan to come home with me, but she wouldn’t or
couldn’t. You can’t think how thin she has grown,
and she mopes like an old woman. I had to coax
her to laugh just once for me before I came away.
I suppose that I oughtn’t to tell, but I will tell
you; you are as deep as the sea. You know Dr.
Towne?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“Well it is all <em>his</em> fault,” said Mary Sherwood in
a mysterious low voice.
</p>
<p>
“Did he give her something to take outwardly
and she took it inwardly?” asked Tessa gravely.
</p>
<p>
“That’s like you, too. You are always laughing
at somebody. How he flirted with poor little
Naughty Nan nobody knows!”
</p>
<p>
“How she flirted with him, you mean.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>
</p>
<p>
“No, I don’t. She was in earnest this time.
He made her presents and took her everywhere;
he always treated her as if—”
</p>
<p>
“—She were his mother.”
</p>
<p>
“I won’t talk to you,” cried Mary indignantly,
“you don’t know any thing about it. You haven’t
seen how white and thin she is! It’s just another
Sue Greyson affair; and every body talks about
how he flirted with her. I comforted Nan by saying
that he had done the same thing before and
would again.”
</p>
<p>
“Did <em>that</em> comfort her?”
</p>
<p>
“It made her angry. I don’t see how she can
mourn over a man with a false heart, do you?”
</p>
<p>
“She would have no occasion to mourn over a
man with a true heart.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you think that he changes his mind?”
asked Mary anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“No, I think that he does not have any mind to
change; he has no mind to flirt or not to flirt; he
simply enjoys himself, not caring for the consequences.”
</p>
<p>
“H’m! What do you call <em>that</em>?”
</p>
<p>
“I do not call it any thing; it would be as well
for you not to talk about your cousin.”
</p>
<p>
“So Gus said; I had to tell him. I’m afraid that
Nan will die.”
</p>
<p>
“No, she will not. It will make her bitter, or it
will make her true.”
</p>
<p>
“Nan is so cut because people talk.”
</p>
<p>
“When is she coming to Dunellen?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
</p>
<p>
“She wouldn’t come with me! How I did coax
her! She will come in September. She says that
she will stay with me until she is married.”
</p>
<p>
“Then she doesn’t intend to take the veil because
of this?”
</p>
<p>
“She did say so—seriously—that she would enter
a convent—”
</p>
<p>
“A monastery!” suggested Tessa.
</p>
<p>
“Where the monks are,” laughed Mary, “I think
that would suit her better.”
</p>
<p>
“And believe me—Dr. Towne is not capable of
doing a cruel or a mean thing—don’t talk to your
cousin about him.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, me! there he is now coming towards us!
On our path, too. I’ll break the rules and run
across the grass if you will.”
</p>
<p>
It was certainly Ralph Towne. He was walking
slowly with his eyes bent upon the ground.
</p>
<p>
“He looks like a monk himself,” whispered Mary,
“he wouldn’t look at us for any thing.”
</p>
<p>
“Halt!” commanded the small military voice
near the monument. He turned to look at the children;
Tessa was close enough to feel the sunshine
in his eyes although his face was not towards her;
he stood watching the soldiers as they tramped on
at the word of command; her dress brushed against
him, she could have laid her hand on his arm; lifting
her eyes with all her grief and disappointment
at his indifference she met his fully; they were
grave and very dark, not one gleam of recognition;
how greatly he had changed! His eyes appeared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>
larger, not so deep set as she remembered them,
and there were many, many white threads running
through his hair. Had Naughty Nan effected all
this? With a slight inclination of his head he
passed on.
</p>
<p>
“He does look as if he had a ‘mind to do or not
do’ something,” said Mary! “I hope that he can’t
sleep nights. He almost slew me with his eyes; I
can’t see why such naughty hearts should look
through such eyes!”
</p>
<p>
“They don’t,” said Tessa, “a good heart was
looking through those eyes.”
</p>
<p>
“H’m! I believe it!”
</p>
<p>
Tessa had walked three blocks in a reverie, scolding
herself for her sympathy with the changed face,
trying to feel indignant that he had passed her by
so coolly, and trying to despise him for so soon
forgetting what she could never forget, when, lo!
there he stood again, face to face with her, speaking
eagerly, his hand already touching hers.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Tessa, what has happened to your eyes?”
</p>
<p>
“Excuse me,” she stammered, “I did not see you.”
</p>
<p>
“How do you do?” he asked more coolly as she
withdrew her hand.
</p>
<p>
“Did you not just pass me in the Park?”
</p>
<p>
“I have not crossed the Park to-day.”
</p>
<p>
“Then I met your ghost.”
</p>
<p>
“Can you not be a little glad to meet me in the
flesh?”
</p>
<p>
“Mary Sherwood was with me and <em>she</em> recognized
you; she saw you before I did.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>
</p>
<p>
He laughed the low amused laugh that she had
heard so often. “My cousin Philip will believe
now that he might be my brother—my twin brother—but
that he appears older than he is. He has
come to Dunellen to take a professorship. He is to
be Greek teacher at the Seminary instead of Professor
Grey. Philip is a rare linguist; he is a rare
scholar. It is the Comedy of Errors over again.
I suppose that he did not talk to you and say that
he was glad to see you again.”
</p>
<p>
“He bowed, he could not but do it. I expect
that he thought I recognized him, as I certainly
did. You will look like him some day, but he will
never look like you.”
</p>
<p>
“Your distinction is not flattering. May I ask
a kindness of you?”
</p>
<p>
“Do you need to ask that?” she answered hurriedly.
</p>
<p>
“My mother is homesick in Dunellen. Will you
call upon her?”
</p>
<p>
She colored, hesitating. After a second, during
which she felt his eyes upon her, she said, “Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“Philip’s father and mine were twins; it is not
the first time that we have been taken for each
other. He has a twin sister.”
</p>
<p>
“And he is like his sister.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, he <em>is</em> like his sister. Imagine me teaching
Greek or preaching in the Park—Phil is a
preacher, of course, and an elocutionist. You will
hear of him; he does not live in a cloister; he is
always doing something for somebody.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
</p>
<p>
“He is a <em>disciplined</em> man; I never saw a person
to whom that word could be so fitly applied.”
</p>
<p>
“And you never thought of applying it to
me.”
</p>
<p>
“I confess that I never did,” she said laughing.
</p>
<p>
“You can see a great deal at a glance.”
</p>
<p>
“That is why I glance.”
</p>
<p>
“Probably you know that I have come to Dunellen
to work.”
</p>
<p>
“I congratulate Dunellen,” she answered prettily.
</p>
<p>
“I hope that you may have reason to do so.
May I tell my mother that you will call?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes—if you wish,” she said, doubtfully, buttoning
a loose button on her glove. “Good afternoon,
Dr. Towne.”
</p>
<p>
She passed on at a quickened pace, her cheeks
glowing, her eyes alight. A stranger, meeting her,
turned for a second look. “She has heard good
news,” he said to himself.
</p>
<p>
<em>Had</em> she heard good news? She had seen the
man that she had so foolishly and fondly believed
Ralph Towne to be; she had learned that she could
not create out of the longings of her own heart a
man too noble and true for God to make out of His
heart. Her ideal had not been too good to be true;
just then it was enough for her to know that her
ideal existed. Her heart could not break because
she was disappointed in Ralph Towne, but it would
have broken had she found that God did not care
to make men good and true. And Ralph Towne
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>
would become good and true some day. And then
she would be glad and not ashamed that she had
trusted in him; she could not be glad and not
ashamed yet. She did not love the man that could
trifle with Sue or flirt with Nan Gerard. She had
loved the ideal in her heart, and not the soul in his
flesh. He could not understand that; he would
call it a fancy, and say that she could make rhyme
to it, but that she could not live the poem. Perhaps
not; if she had loved him she might have
lived a different poem; her living and loving, her
doing and giving, would be a poem, anyway; she
did not love Ralph Towne to-day, she was only
afraid that she did. He could not understand the
woman who would prefer Philip Towne’s saintliness;
he was assured that his money would outweigh
it with any maiden in Dunellen—with any
maiden but Tessa Wadsworth; he was beginning
to understand her. “She did not ask me to call,”
he soliloquized. The stranger passing him also,
gave him also a second glance, but he did not say
to himself, “He has heard good news.” <em>Was</em> it
good news that the woman that he had thoughtlessly
deceived held herself aloof from him and
above him?
</p>
<p>
“She loved me once,” he soliloquized, “and love
with her must die a hard death.”
</p>
<p>
How hard a death even Tessa herself could not
comprehend; she understood years afterward when
she said: “I thought once that I never could be as
glad as I had been sorrowful; but I learned that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>
the power to be glad was infinitely greater than
the power of being sorrowful.”
</p>
<p>
That evening her father called her to say: “The
new professor is to preach Sunday evening before
church service in the Park; you and I will go to
hear him.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span><a name='ch13' id='ch13'></a>XIII.—THE HEART OF LOVE.</h2>
<p>
The day lilies were in bloom, and that meant
August; it meant also that her book was written,
rewritten, and ready to be copied.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, that my poor little book were as perfect as
you,” she sighed one morning as she arranged them
with their broad, green leaves for the vases in parlor
and sitting-room. “But God made you with
His own fingers, and He made my book through
my own fancies.”
</p>
<p>
She had worked early and late, not flagging,
through all the sultry days. “You will make
yourself sick,” her mother had warned, “and it
will cost you all you earn to buy beef tea and pay
the doctor; so where is the good of it?”
</p>
<p>
She had read her manuscript aloud to her father,
and he had laughed and wiped his eyes and given
sundry appreciative exclamations.
</p>
<p>
“That writing takes a precious sight of time,”
her mother had remonstrated.
</p>
<p>
“That is because I am human.” Tessa had answered
soberly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>
</p>
<p>
“Suppose it is refused.”
</p>
<p>
“Then I’ll be like William Howitt; his book was
refused four times and he stood on London bridge
ready to toss it over. I do not think that I will do
as Charlotte Bronte did; she sent a rejected manuscript
to a publisher wrapped in the wrapper in
which the first publisher had rolled it. I suppose
that his address was printed on it.”
</p>
<p>
She had run on merrily as she had placed the
cool, pure lilies in the vase; but her heart was sinking,
nevertheless. It had always taken so little to
exhilarate or depress her.
</p>
<p>
“Must you write to-day?” inquired her mother
one morning in an unsatisfied tone.
</p>
<p>
“Several hours.”
</p>
<p>
“I wanted you to make calls with me and to help
me with the currant jelly and to put those button-holes
into my linen wrapper.”
</p>
<p>
“I can do it all, but I must write while I am
fresh.”
</p>
<p>
The first hour she wrote wearily; then she lost
the small struggles in her own life and became
comforted through the comfort wherewith she comforted
others. Not one thing was forgotten, not
one household duty shirked, the jelly was made to
perfection, the button-holes worked while her mother
was taking her afternoon nap, the calls were
pushed through, and then Mrs. Wadsworth proposed
a call upon Mrs. Towne.
</p>
<p>
“I promised your Aunt Dinah that I would call.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa demurred although she remembered her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
promise; she much preferred calling some time
when Aunt Dinah should be with her; Mrs. Wadsworth
insisted and Tessa yielded more graciously
in manner than in mind.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Towne received them most cordially and
gracefully; an expression flitted over her eyes as
Tessa looked up into them that she never forgot;
it touched her as Dr. Lake’s eyes did, sometimes;
what could this beautiful old mother need in her?
Whatever it might be, she felt fully prepared to
give it.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Wadsworth was as effusively talkative as
usual; Tessa replied when spoken to; lively, fussy,
pretty little Mrs. Wadsworth did not compare to
her own advantage with her womanly daughter.
Mrs. Towne looked at Tessa and thought of the
picture that she had seen; it was certainly excellent
only that the picture was rather too intellectual;
in the picture she might have written “Mechanism
of the Heavens” but sitting there in the
crimson velvet chair with a pale blue bow among
her braids and her soft gray veil shading her cheek
she was more like the daughter that she had ever
dreamed of—simple, sweet, and thoroughly lovable
Mrs. Towne was a trifle afraid of a woman who
looked <em>too</em> intellectual. Would she forgive Ralph
and trust him again? She was sure that she would
until Tessa unbuttoned her glove and drew it off;
the slight, strong hand was a revelation; the girl
had a will of her own. But might not her will
be towards him? “I wish that I knew nothing,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>
thought the mother, “the suspense will weary me,
the disappointment will be nearly as much for me
as for the boy.”
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, unconscious Tessa, with the glove in
her fingers, was far away in the Milan cathedral
on the wall opposite her, looking into the arches of
the choir, feeling the sunlight through the glimmering
painted windows, thinking about the procession
of the scarlet-robed priests, and wondering
about the hidden chancel; if the picture were upon
her wall how it would glow and become alive in the
western light, the drooping banners would stir with
the breath of the evening, the censers would swing
and the notes of the organ would bear her up and
away. Away! Where? Was not all her world
in this little Dunellen?
</p>
<p>
“My son is always busy; he rushes into every
thing that he undertakes.”
</p>
<p>
The mother had a voice like the son’s; the soul
of sincerity was in it; the sincere, sympathetic
voice, the rush of feeling, love, regret, and sense
of loss that it brought filled her eyes too full to be
raised. At that instant Mrs. Towne was observing
her; her heart grew lighter, hoping for the thing
that might be.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Towne held Tessa’s hand at parting. “I am
an old woman, so I may ask a favor of a young one,
will you come soon again?”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you, yes.”
</p>
<p>
“And often?”
</p>
<p>
Then she had to promise again. Dr. Towne was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>
seldom at home; she thought of this when she
promised. She was thinking of it that evening in
the early twilight as she weeded among her pansies.
Dine said that it was a wonder that she had
not turned into a pansy herself by this time.
</p>
<p>
“Daughter, why do you sigh?”
</p>
<p>
Her father was seated in a rustic chair on the
piazza with a copy of <em>Burns</em> unopened upon his
knee; he had left the store earlier than usual that
afternoon, complaining of the old pain in his side.
</p>
<p>
“My sigh must be very loud or your ears very
sharp,” she replied, lifting her head. “I will bring
you some perfect pansies.”
</p>
<p>
He took them and looked down at them; she
stood at his side smoothing the straggling locks
on his bald forehead with her perfumed, soiled fingers.
“I think that if I knew nothing about God
but that He made pansies, I should love Him for
that,” she said at last.
</p>
<p>
“Is <em>that</em> what you were sighing over?”
</p>
<p>
“The sigh came out of the heart of the pansy.
I wish I knew how to love somebody.”
</p>
<p>
“Is that what you were sighing over?”
</p>
<p>
“I do not know how,” rubbing the soil from her
fingers, “to love when I lose faith. I do not know
how and it worries me.”
</p>
<p>
“You mean that you do not know how to honor
and trust when you lose faith. Are you so far on
the journey of life as that? Must I congratulate
you, daughter?”
</p>
<p>
“No; teach me.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>
</p>
<p>
“No human teaching can teach you to love
where you have lost faith.”
</p>
<p>
“Well; nobody asks me to!”
</p>
<p>
“If any body ever does, look at your own failings;
that pulls me through.”
</p>
<p>
“I understand that,” still speaking in a troubled
voice, “but all the love and patience do no good;
people do not change because we love them.”
</p>
<p>
“No, they do not change, but <em>we</em> change.”
</p>
<p>
“That is not enough for me; I am not satisfied
with the blessing of giving, I want the other somebody
to have the blessing of receiving.”
</p>
<p>
“We do not know the end.”
</p>
<p>
“You two people do find queer things to talk
about,” cried a lively voice behind them. “If I
knew what mystical meant, I should say that it
was you and Tessa. Don’t you want to hear all
about Mrs. Towne, and what a <em>lovely</em> room we
were taken into?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, dear, and how her hair was fixed and just
how she was dressed.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa ran back to her pansies; Mrs. Wadsworth
had found a theme to enlarge upon for the next
half hour. As Tessa worked among the flowers, a
poem that she had learned that day while making
the button-holes sang itself through and through
her heart.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;hurt&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;hurt&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;hurt&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;love!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherever&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;sun&nbsp;&nbsp;shines,&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;waters&nbsp;&nbsp;go,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&nbsp;&nbsp;hurts&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;snowdrop,&nbsp;&nbsp;it&nbsp;&nbsp;hurts&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;dove,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God&nbsp;&nbsp;on&nbsp;&nbsp;His&nbsp;&nbsp;throne,&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;man&nbsp;&nbsp;below.<br />
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But&nbsp;&nbsp;sun&nbsp;&nbsp;would&nbsp;&nbsp;not&nbsp;&nbsp;shine&nbsp;&nbsp;nor&nbsp;&nbsp;waters&nbsp;&nbsp;go,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snowdrop&nbsp;&nbsp;tremble&nbsp;&nbsp;nor&nbsp;&nbsp;fair&nbsp;&nbsp;dove&nbsp;&nbsp;moan,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God&nbsp;&nbsp;be&nbsp;&nbsp;on&nbsp;&nbsp;high,&nbsp;&nbsp;nor&nbsp;&nbsp;man&nbsp;&nbsp;below,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But&nbsp;&nbsp;for&nbsp;&nbsp;love—the&nbsp;&nbsp;love&nbsp;&nbsp;with&nbsp;&nbsp;its&nbsp;&nbsp;hurt&nbsp;&nbsp;alone.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou&nbsp;&nbsp;knowest,&nbsp;&nbsp;O,&nbsp;&nbsp;Saviour,&nbsp;&nbsp;its&nbsp;&nbsp;hurt&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;its&nbsp;&nbsp;sorrows,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Didst&nbsp;&nbsp;rescue&nbsp;&nbsp;its&nbsp;&nbsp;joy&nbsp;&nbsp;by&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;might&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy&nbsp;&nbsp;pain;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;all&nbsp;&nbsp;yesterdays,&nbsp;&nbsp;days,&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;to-morrows,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Help&nbsp;&nbsp;us&nbsp;&nbsp;love&nbsp;&nbsp;on&nbsp;&nbsp;in&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;hope&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy&nbsp;&nbsp;gain!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hurt&nbsp;&nbsp;as&nbsp;&nbsp;it&nbsp;&nbsp;may,&nbsp;&nbsp;love&nbsp;&nbsp;on,&nbsp;&nbsp;love&nbsp;&nbsp;forever;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love&nbsp;&nbsp;for&nbsp;&nbsp;love’s&nbsp;&nbsp;sake&nbsp;&nbsp;like&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;Father&nbsp;&nbsp;above,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But&nbsp;&nbsp;for&nbsp;&nbsp;whose&nbsp;&nbsp;brave-hearted&nbsp;&nbsp;Son&nbsp;&nbsp;we&nbsp;&nbsp;had&nbsp;&nbsp;never<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Known&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;sweet&nbsp;&nbsp;hurt&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;sorrowful&nbsp;&nbsp;love.”<br />
</p>
<p>
“I am not sincere in repeating that,” she mused.
“I <em>don’t</em> love on, love forever—and I don’t want
to! If I were in a book, every thing would make
no difference, nothing would make a difference—would
love on, love forever—and I don’t know
how. I wish I did. It would not change <em>him</em>, but
it would make <em>me</em> very glad and very good! I
can not attain to it.”
</p>
<p>
The grazing sound of wheels brought her back
to the pansies, then to Dr. Lake; he had driven up
close to the opening in the lilac shrubbery.
</p>
<p>
“Ah, Mystic.”
</p>
<p>
“Good evening, doctor.”
</p>
<p>
It was the first time that they had been alone
together since Sue’s engagement. She had been
dreading this first time. She arose and brushed
her hands against each other, moving towards the
opening in the lilacs.
</p>
<p>
“I saw you, and could not resist the temptation
of stopping to speak to you.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>
</p>
<p>
“Thank you,” she said warmly. “Will you have
a lily?”
</p>
<p>
“No, lilies are not for me. Briers and thorns
grow for me.”
</p>
<p>
“Where are you riding to now?”
</p>
<p>
“Felix Harrison came home yesterday worse
than ever. I was there in the night and am going
again. Why don’t he die now that he has a
chance? Catch me throwing away such an opportunity.”
</p>
<p>
“I hope that you will never have such an opportunity,”
she answered, not thinking of what she
was saying.
</p>
<p>
“That’s always the way; the lucky ones die, the
unlucky ones live.”
</p>
<p>
“Can you not resist the temptation to tell me
any thing so trite as that?”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t be sharp, Mystic.”
</p>
<p>
She was leaning against the low fence, her hands
folded over each other, a breath of air stirring the
wavy hair around her temples, and touching the
pale blue ribbon at her throat, a white, graceful
figure, speaking in her animated way with the
flush of the pink rose tinting her cheeks and a
misty veil shadowing her eyes.
</p>
<p>
“A very pretty picture in a frame-work of brown
and green,” thought the old man in the rustic chair
on the piazza.
</p>
<p>
But she never thought of making a picture of herself,
she left such small coquetries to girls who had
nothing better to do or to think of. She had her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>
life to live and her books to write! Nevertheless
two pairs of eyes found her pleasant to look upon.
Dr. Lake’s experiences had opened his eyes to see
that Tessa Wadsworth was unlike any woman that
he had ever known; she was to him the calm of
the moonlight, the fragrance of the spring, and the
restfulness of trust.
</p>
<p>
In these weeks of his trouble, had she been like
some other of the Dunellen girls, she would have
found her way without pushing into his heart by
the wide door that shallow Sue had left ajar.
</p>
<p>
His heart was open to any attractive woman
who would sympathize with him; to any woman
who would be glad of what Sue Greyson had thrown
away; she might have become aware of this but
for her instinctive habit of looking upward to love;
even the tenderest compassion mingled with some
admiration could not grow into love with her in
her present moods; she was too young and asked
too much of life for such a possibility.
</p>
<p>
In these days every man was too far below George
Macdonald and Frederick Robertson, unless indeed
it might be the new Greek professor; in her secret
heart she had begun to wonder if Philip Towne
were not something like them both; perhaps because
in his sermon that Sunday twilight in the
Park he had quoted a “declaration of Robertson’s”—“I
am better acquainted with Jesus Christ than
I am with any man on earth.”
</p>
<p>
The words came to her as she stood, to-night,
talking with Dr Lake; she was wishing that she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>
might repeat them to him; instead she only replied,
“Why shouldn’t I be sharp? You are a man and
therefore able to bear it.”
</p>
<p>
“Not much of a man—or wholly a man. I reckon
that is nearer right. I never saw a man yet
that a blow from a woman’s little finger wouldn’t
knock him over.”
</p>
<p>
“Not any woman’s finger.”
</p>
<p>
“Any thing would blow me over to-night. Why
do women have to make so many things when they
are married?” he asked earnestly.
</p>
<p>
“To keep the love they have won,” she said with
a mischievous laugh. “Don’t you know how soon
roses fade after they are rudely torn from the protection
and nourishment of the parent stem?”
</p>
<p>
“Rudely! They flutter, they pant, they struggle
to tear themselves loose! Why do you suppose that
she prefers Stacey to me?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know all things.”
</p>
<p>
“You know that. Answer.”
</p>
<p>
“She does not prefer <em>him</em>. He is the smallest
part of her calculations. Marriage with you would
make no change in her life; she seeks change; she
has never been married and lived in Philadelphia—therefore
to be married and live in Philadelphia must be glorious.”
</p>
<p>
“Then if I had money to take her anywhere and
everywhere she would have married me. I’ll turn
highwayman to get rich then. She shows me every
pretty thing she makes; dresses up in all her new
dresses and asks me if I feel like the bridegroom
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
lends me her engagement ring when she is tired of
it. I’d bite it in two if I dared—reads me his letters
and asks me to help her answer them for she can
only write a page and a half out of her own head.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa laughed; it was better to laugh than to be
angry, and Sue could not be any body but Sue
Greyson.
</p>
<p>
“She says that her only objection to him is his
name and age; she likes my name better, and scribbles
Sue Greyson Lake over his old envelopes. I
would like to send him one of them. I was reading
in the paper this morning of a man who shot
the girl that refused him; if I don’t shoot her it will
not be her fault, she is driving me mad. If I can’t
have her myself, <em>he</em> sha’n’t!”
</p>
<p>
She dropped her hands and turned away from
him.
</p>
<p>
“Mystic.” But she was among the pansies again.
</p>
<p>
“Mystic,” with the tone in his voice that she
would never forget, “come back. Don’t <em>you</em> throw
me over; I shall go to destruction if you do.”
</p>
<p>
“I can not help you. You do not try to help
yourself.”
</p>
<p>
“I know it. I don’t want to be helped. I drift.
I have no will to struggle. She plays with me like
a cat with a mouse. I do not know what I am
about half the time. I will take a double dose of
morphine some night. I wonder if she would cry
if she saw me dead. Men have done such things
with less provocation; men of my temperament,
too. Would <em>you</em> be sorry, Mystic?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>
</p>
<p>
She stretched out her hands to take his hand in
both hers: “Don’t talk so,” she said brokenly. “You
know you do not mean it; why can’t you be brave
and good? I didn’t know that men were so weak.”
</p>
<p>
“I <em>am</em> weak—I have strayed, I have wandered
away—but I can go back.”
</p>
<p>
Long afterward she remembered these words;
they, with his last “good-by, Mystic,” were all that
she cared to remember among all the words that
he had ever spoken to her.
</p>
<p>
She did not speak; she moved her fingers caressingly
over his hand, thinking how pliant and feminine,
how characteristic, it was.
</p>
<p>
“I know a woman’s heart,” he ran on lightly;
“she is not a sacred mystery to me, as the fellows
say in books. I dissected an old negro woman’s
heart once; she died of enlargement of the heart,
so that it was as much a study as the largest heart
of her kind. Sue is going out to-night with Towne
and his mother—it’s a pity that <em>he</em> wouldn’t step in
now—she might let us all have a fair fight, and old
Gesner, too, with his simpering voice! She would
take Gesner only he doesn’t propose. ‘Thirty days
hath September.’ I wish it had thirty thousand.
When I was a youngster, and got a beating for not
learning that, I little thought that one day I <em>would</em>
learn it and count the days every night. Oh, that
rare and radiant first of October! Do you know,”
bending forward and lowering his tone, “that she
is more than half inclined to throw him over?”
</p>
<p>
“She is never more than half inclined to do
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
anything,” answered Tessa indignantly. “I wish that
he were here to keep her out of mischief. Why
do you stay so much with her? Surely you have
business enough to keep you out of her presence.”
</p>
<p>
He laughed excitedly. “Keep a starving man
away from bread when he has only to stretch out
his hand and snatch it.”
</p>
<p>
“You have found that your doll is stuffed with
sawdust, can’t you toss it aside?”
</p>
<p>
“I love sawdust,” he answered, comically.
</p>
<p>
“Then I’m ashamed of you.”
</p>
<p>
“You haven’t seen other men tried.”
</p>
<p>
“It is no honor to you to be thinking of her
under existing circumstances.”
</p>
<p>
“I would run away with her to-night if she
would run with me.”
</p>
<p>
“Then I despise you.”
</p>
<p>
“You love like a woman, Mystic; I love like a
man.”
</p>
<p>
“I hope that no man will ever dishonor himself
or dishonor me with love like that.”
</p>
<p>
As he stooped to pick up his glove, his breath
swept her cheek; she started, almost exclaiming
as she drew back, flushed and bewildered. He
colored angrily, then laughed an excited, reckless
laugh, and gathered the reins which had been
hanging loose.
</p>
<p>
“Dr. Lake,” in a hurried, tremulous voice, “please
don’t do that. Oh, why must you? Why can’t
you be brave?” Her voice was choking with
tears. “I did not <em>think</em> such a thing of you.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
</p>
<p>
“Of course you didn’t! But I will not do it
again—I really will not. I am half mad as I told
you. Good night, Mystic.”
</p>
<p>
“Good night,” she said sadly.
</p>
<p>
He held the reins still lingering.
</p>
<p>
“Will you ride with me again some day?”
</p>
<p>
“No, I don’t like to hear you talk.”
</p>
<p>
Again she went back to her pansies; the innocent
pansies with their faint, pure breath were
more congenial. As he drove under the maples,
he muttered words that would have startled her
as much as his tainted breath.
</p>
<p>
“Do you like it in this world, little pansies?”
she sighed.
</p>
<p>
Her father laid his book within a window on the
sill, and came down to her to talk about the buds
of the day-lilies; her mother fanned herself with
a palm-leaf fan and complained of the heat; Dinah
ran down-stairs, fresh and airy in green muslin
with a scarlet geranium among her curls, and
after standing still to ask if she looked pretty, ran
across to the planks to walk up and down with
Norah Bird with their arms linked and their heads
close together.
</p>
<p>
Tessa sighed again, remembering the old confidential
talks with Laura when they both cared for
the same things before she had outgrown Laura.
There were so many things in her world to be
sighed about to-night; the thought of Felix threw
all her life into shadow; Norah and Dinah were
laughing over some silly thing, and her mother
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>
was vigorously waving the fan and vigorously
fretting at the heat and the dust in this same
hour in which Felix—her bright, good Felix—was
moaning out his feeble strength. She had not
dared to ask Dr. Lake how he was; what comfort
would it be to know that he was a little better or
a little worse? How could she talk to him of her
busy life and take him a copy of her book? She
was counting the days, also; for in October her
book would surely be out.
</p>
<p>
“You think more of that than you would of being
married,” Dinah had said that day.
</p>
<p>
“So I do—than to be married to any one I
know.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you expect to find somebody <em>new</em>?”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps I do not expect to find any one at all,”
she had answered.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, don’t be so dreary,” laughed Dinah.
</p>
<p>
<em>Was</em> that dreary? Once it might have seemed
dreary; a year ago with what a smiting pain she
would have echoed the word, but it was not a
dreary prospect to-night as she stood with her
father’s arm about her.
</p>
<p>
A new thing had happened to disturb her; Dinah
was becoming shy and constrained in the presence
of Mr. Hammerton; last summer she would
run out to meet him, hang on his arm and chatter
like a magpie; this summer she would oftener
avoid him than move forward to greet him; this
shamefacedness was altogether new and very becoming,
yet the elder sister did not like it. There
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>
was no change in Mr. Hammerton, why should
there be change in Dinah or in herself? He came
no oftener than he had come last summer, he
manifested no preference, sometimes she thought that
this non-manifestation was too studied; gifts were
brought to each, were it books or flowers. Did poor
little Dine care for him, and was she so afraid of
revealing it? Or, had she decided that it was for
<em>her</em> sake that he came, and did she leave them so
often together alone that it might be pleasanter
for both? More than once or twice when he was
expected, she had pleaded an engagement with
Norah, and had not appeared until late in the
evening.
</p>
<p>
“I wonder what’s got Dine,” their mother had
remarked, “she seems possessed to run away from
Gus.”
</p>
<p>
Their father had looked annoyed and exclaimed,
“Nonsense, mother, nonsense.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa’s reverie was ended by Mr. Hammerton’s
quick step upon the planks.
</p>
<p>
“He was here last night,” commented Mrs.
Wadsworth as he crossed the street.
</p>
<p>
“Good evening, good people,” he said opening
the gate. “You make quite a picture! If you had
fruit and wine I should rub up my French or Spanish.
I think that I am not too late; I did not hear
until after tea that Professor Towne is to read tonight
in Association Hall; some of your favorites,
Lady Blue. Will you go, you and Dine?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes, indeed; that is just what I want.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
</p>
<p>
“It is to be selections from ‘Henry V.,’ ‘The
High Tide,’ ‘Locksley Hall,’ I think, and a few
lighter things. You will think that you would
rather elocute ‘The High Tide’ than even to have
written it.”
</p>
<p>
“That is impossible. Did you tell Dine?”
</p>
<p>
“No, but I will. It was proper to ask the elder
sister was it not?”
</p>
<p>
“I am not Leah,” said Tessa seriously, “call
Rachel.”
</p>
<p>
“Rachel! Rachel!” he called, beckoning to Dinah.
Dinah whistled by way of reply and dropped
Norah’s arm.
</p>
<p>
“Have you brought me Mother Goose or a
sugar-plum?” she asked lightly. “And why do you
call me Rachel?”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t talk nonsense, children,” said Mr. Wadsworth
very gravely. The color deepened in Mr.
Hammerton’s cheeks and forehead as he met the
old man’s grave eyes. “Mother, let’s you and I
go too,” proposed Mr. Wadsworth, “we will
imagine it to be twenty-seven years ago.”
</p>
<p>
“I only wish it was,” was the dissatisfied reply.
</p>
<p>
That evening was an event in Tessa’s quiet life:
she heard no sound but the reader’s voice, she saw
no face but his; she drew a long breath when the
last words were uttered.
</p>
<p>
“Was it so good as all that?” whispered Mr.
Hammerton. “You shall go to the Chapel with
me next Sunday and hear him preach about
‘Meditation.’”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>
</p>
<p>
Dr. Towne, his mother, and Sue Greyson were
seated near them; she did not observe the group
until she arose to leave the hall.
</p>
<p>
“Wasn’t it stupid?” muttered Sue, catching at
her sleeve. “And isn’t he perfectly elegant? Almost
as elegant as the doctor.”
</p>
<p>
“You will not forget your promise?” Mrs. Towne
said as Tessa turned towards her.
</p>
<p>
“Has Miss Tessa been making you a promise?
She does not know how to break her word,” said
Dr. Towne.
</p>
<p>
“You do not need to tell me that; her eyes are
promise-keepers.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Towne kept her at her side until they
reached the entrance and would have detained her
until Professor Towne had made his way to them,
had not Mr. Hammerton understood by the moving
of her lips that she was not pleased and hurried
her away.
</p>
<p>
“I hope that I shall never become acquainted
with Professor Towne,” exclaimed Tessa nervously,
as Mr. Hammerton drew her hand within his arm.
</p>
<p>
“Why not? I thought that you were wrapped
up in him as the young ladies say.”
</p>
<p>
“Suppose I make a hole in him and find him
stuffed with sawdust.”
</p>
<p>
“You could immediately retire into a convent.”
</p>
<p>
Dinah had mischievously fallen behind with her
father and mother.
</p>
<p>
“Then I could never find my <em>good</em> man?”
</p>
<p>
“Must you find him or die forlorn?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>
</p>
<p>
For several moments she found no answer: then
the words came deliberately; “Perhaps I <em>need</em> not;
I wonder why I thought there was a <em>must</em> in the
matter; why may I not be happy and helpful without
ending as good little girls do in fairy stories?
I need not live or die forlorn—and yet—Gus,
you are the only person in the whole world
to whom I would confess that I would rather be
like the good little girl in the fairy story! Please
forget it.”
</p>
<p>
“It is too pleasant to forget,” he answered. “I
do not want you to be too ambitious or too wise
for the good old fashions of wife and mother!”
</p>
<p>
“How can any woman be that!” she exclaimed
indignantly.
</p>
<p>
“May you never know.”
</p>
<p>
“What an easy time Eve had! All she had to
do was to be led to Adam. She would not have
chosen him a while afterward; he was altogether
too much under her influence.”
</p>
<p>
“That weakness has become a part of our original
sin.”
</p>
<p>
“It isn’t yours,” she retorted.
</p>
<p>
“Am I so different from other men?” he asked
in a constrained voice.
</p>
<p>
“Most assuredly. I should as soon think of a
whole row of encyclopedias falling in love.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Hammerton was silent, for once repartee
failed him.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly she asked, “Is your imagination a trial
to you?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>
</p>
<p>
“Haven’t you often told me that I am stupid as
an old geometry.”
</p>
<p>
“And I hate geometry.”
</p>
<p>
“You read, you write, you live, you love through
your imagination. You wrap the person you love
in a rosy mist that is the breath of your hopeful
heart, and you see your hero through that mist. Of
course the mist fades and you have but the ugly outline—then,
without stopping to see what God hath
wrought, you cry out, ‘Oh, the horrible! the dreadful!’
and run away with your fingers in your ears.”
</p>
<p>
A few silent steps, then she said, “I deserve that.
It is all true. Why did you not tell me before?”
</p>
<p>
“I left it to time and common sense.”
</p>
<p>
“It will take a great deal of both to make me
sensible,” she answered humbly, and then added,
“if suffering would root out my fancies—but I am
like the child that tumbles and tumbles, and then
tumbles again. I need to be guided by such a
steady hand. Sometimes I do long so for somebody
to do me good.”
</p>
<p>
Her companion’s silence might be sympathetic;
as such she interpreted it, or she could not have said
what she never ceased wondering at herself for saying—“I
am not disappointed in love; but I <em>am</em> disappointed
in loving. I thought that love was once
and forever. Poets say so.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, but we do not know how they live their
poetry.”
</p>
<p>
“I know that my poetry fails me when extremity
comes.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>
</p>
<p>
“Has the extremity come?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” she said bravely.
</p>
<p>
“And that is another thing that I am not to
know.”
</p>
<p>
“Not for five and fifty years. I will pigeon-hole
all my experiences for you—if there is no one to
object on my side or yours.”
</p>
<p>
“What about the reading? Was it all that you
expected?”
</p>
<p>
“Wait a minute; call Dine before we talk it over.”
</p>
<p>
They had outwalked the others; Mr. Hammerton’s
strides would not be pleasant to keep pace
with in the long walk of life, as Dinah had once
told him. It was a truth that no one recognized so
well as himself, that he lacked the power of adaptation;
he was too tall or too short, too broad or
too narrow, too crooked or too straight for any
niche in Dunellen, but the one that he had found in
his boyhood by the snug, safe corner in the home
where Dinah was growing up to entangle herself
in his heart, and Tessa, lovable and wise, to enthrone
herself in his intellect. In the game of forfeits,
when he had been doomed to “Bow to the
wittiest, kneel to the prettiest, and kiss the one
you love the best,” in the long ago evenings, when
they were all, old and young, children together, he
had always bowed to Tessa and knelt to bewitching
little Dine and kissed her. Now he bowed to
Tessa, but he did not kiss Dine.
</p>
<p>
They stood waiting near a lamp-post; he, fidgeting
as usual, she, straight and still.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>
</p>
<p>
“Lady Blue, you never put me on a pedestal, did
you?”
</p>
<p>
“No, you never kept still long enough.”
</p>
<p>
Professor Towne passed them with Mrs. Towne
leaning upon his arm; Mrs. Towne bowed and
smiled, he lifted his hat in recognition of Tessa’s
hesitating half inclination.
</p>
<p>
“Why, Tessa! Do you know him?”
</p>
<p>
“I almost spoke to him one day by mistake; I
did not intend to bow, but he looked at me—I suppose
the bow bowed itself.”
</p>
<p>
“He has a noble presence! He is altogether
finer physically than his cousin.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know that he is,” she answered wilfully.
Dinah came willingly enough; they walked
more slowly and talked.
</p>
<p>
“Tessa,” began Dine abruptly as they were brushing
their hair at bedtime, “isn’t Gus a fine talker?”
</p>
<p>
“Is he like Coleridge? He could talk four hours
without interruption, but sometimes his listeners,
learned men too, did not understand a word of it.”
</p>
<p>
“I do not always understand Gus.”
</p>
<p>
“Gus does not ramble; he is plain enough.”
</p>
<p>
Dine brushed out a long curl and looked down
upon it. “I shall ask him to give me a list of books
that I ought to read.”
</p>
<p>
“I confess that while I understand what he says
I do not understand <em>him</em>. If you do, you are wiser
than I.”
</p>
<p>
“I guess that I am wiser than you.”
</p>
<p>
“I used to think that I understood people; I have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>
come to the conclusion that I do not understand
even my own self.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you like garnet? I want a garnet in some
material this winter. Gus says that I am a butterfly.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, you are pretty in warm colors.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa drew a chair to the open window and sat
a long time leaning her elbows on the sill with her
face towards the Harrison Homestead. Felix had
always been so proud of the old house with its tiled
chimney-pieces, with its ancient crockery brought
from Holland and the iron bound Bible with the
names of his ancestors; for two hundred years the
place had been held in the Harrison name, a great-great-grandfather
having purchased the land from
the Indians. He had said once to her, “I have a
good old honest name to give to you, Tessa.” She
would have worn his name worthily for his sake;
if it might be,—but her father would hold her back,—why
should she not sacrifice herself? Was not
Felix worthy of her devotion? What other grander
thing could she ever do? The moon was rising;
she changed her position to watch it and did not
leave it until it stood high above the apple orchard.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span><a name='ch14' id='ch14'></a>XIV.—WHEAT, NOT BREAD.</h2>
<p>
Early one evening Tessa was writing alone in
her own chamber; Dinah was spending a few
days in Dunellen; while Dinah was away she
wrote more than usual out of her loneliness.
</p>
<p>
Becoming wearied she laid the neat manuscript
away and began scribbling with a pencil on a half
sheet of foolscap; the disconnected words revealed
the thoughts that had been troubling her all day.
</p>
<p>
“Counsel. Waiting. Asking. Deception.
Years and years. Oh, I <em>want</em> to go to heaven.”
</p>
<p>
A tap at the door sounded twice before it broke
upon her reverie; absent-mindedly she opened
the door, but the absent-mindedness was lost in
the flash of light that burst over her face when
she recognized, in the twilight, the one person in
all the world whom she wished to see.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I was wishing for you! Did some good
spirit send you.”
</p>
<p>
“I have been feeling all day that you wanted
me,” said the little woman suffering herself to be
drawn into the room. “What are you doing?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>
</p>
<p>
“Feeling wicked and miserable and wanting to
go to heaven.”
</p>
<p>
“You are not the kind to go to heaven, you are
the kind to stay on earth; what would you do in
heaven if you do not love to do God’s will on
earth?”
</p>
<p>
Tessa drew her rocker nearer the open window
and seated her guest in it, moved a low seat beside
it, and sat down folding her hands in her lap.
</p>
<p>
“What shall I do on earth?” she asked.
</p>
<p>
“What you are told.”
</p>
<p>
“I can not always see or hear what I must do.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s a pity.”
</p>
<p>
“Can you?”
</p>
<p>
“I could not once; I can now.”
</p>
<p>
“How can you now?”
</p>
<p>
“Because I desire but one thing—and that is always
made plain to me.”
</p>
<p>
“But how can you get over <em>wanting</em> things?”
</p>
<p>
“I can not.”
</p>
<p>
“I do not understand.”
</p>
<p>
“I mean only this, dear child; I do want things,
but I want God’s will most of all.”
</p>
<p>
“Sometimes I think I do, and then I <em>know</em> that I
do not. Do you think,” lowering her voice and
speaking more slowly, “that He ever <em>deceives</em> any
body?”
</p>
<p>
“He sometimes, oftentimes, allows them to be
deceived,—is that what you mean?”
</p>
<p>
“He does not do it.”
</p>
<p>
“No, but He allows others to do it.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>
</p>
<p>
“Not—when—they pray—about it and ask what
they may do—would He let somebody who prayed
be deceived?”
</p>
<p>
Miss Jewett was removing her gloves. She
smoothed out each finger and thumb before she
spoke, and laid them on the window-sill.
</p>
<p>
“I have been trying to think—oh, now, I know!
Do you not remember one whom He permitted to
be deceived after asking His counsel?”
</p>
<p>
“No. I thought the thing impossible. I do not
see how such a thing can be.”
</p>
<p>
“It can be; it has been. What for, do you suppose?”
</p>
<p>
“To teach some lesson. I am learning—oh, how
bitterly!—that His teaching is the best of His
gifts.”
</p>
<p>
“So it is, child; but oh, how we have to be
crushed before we can believe it. Is your life so
hard? It appears a very happy life to me.”
</p>
<p>
“So every one else thinks. I suppose it would
be, but that I make my own trials; <em>do</em> I make
them? No, I don’t! How can I make things
hard when I only do what seems the only right
thing to do. Tell me about that somebody who
was deceived—like me,” she added.
</p>
<p>
“He was a priest; he ministered before the Lord,
and he believed in David, because he was an honorable
man, and high in the king’s household; so
when David came to him and said: ‘The king hath
commanded me a business, and hath said unto me,
Let no man know it,’ of course, he believed him,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>
and when he asked him for bread the old priest
would have given it, not thinking that in harboring
the king’s son-in-law he was guilty of treason;
but he had no bread; he had nothing but
the shew-bread, which only the priests might eat.
He did not dare give him that until he asked counsel
of the Lord. No priest had ever dared before,
and how could he dare? But David and his men
were starving, they dared go to no one else for
help; but the priest didn’t know that, poor, old,
trustful man, so he asked counsel, and having obtained
permission, he gave to David the hallowed
bread. That was right, because our Lord approves
of it; then David asked for Goliath’s sword, and he
gave him that, and went to sleep that night as
sweetly as the night before, I have no doubt, because
he had asked counsel of the Lord and followed
it.”
</p>
<p>
“Did any harm come to him?” asked Tessa,
quickly.
</p>
<p>
“Harm! He lost his head; Saul slew him for
treason; and he pleaded before the king: ‘And who
is so faithful among all thy servants as David,
which is the king’s son-in-law, and goeth at thy
bidding, and is honorable in thine house?’ God
could have warned him or have brought to his ears
the news that David was an outlaw, but He suffered
him to be deceived and lose his life for trusting
in the man who was telling him a lie.”
</p>
<p>
After a silence Tessa said: “He <em>had</em> to obey!
I’m glad that he obeyed; I believe that was written
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>
just for me. I asked God once to let somebody
love me, and I trusted him, because I thought that
God had given him to me—and it has broken my
heart with shame. I did not know before that He
let me be deceived; I knew that I was obeying
Him, but I thought that my humiliation was my
punishment for doing I knew not what.”
</p>
<p>
“Now I know the secret of some of your articles
that I have cried over; not less than ten people told
me how much they were helped by that article of
yours, ‘Night and Day.’”
</p>
<p>
“I have three letters that I will show you sometime;
I know that my trouble has worn a channel
in my heart through which God’s blessing flows;
except for that I should have almost died.”
</p>
<p>
“You do not look like dying; your eyes are as
clear as a bell, and there’s plenty of fun in you yet.”
</p>
<p>
“The fun and sarcasm are a little bit sanctified,
I think; I never say sharp things nowadays.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps the answer to your prayer has not all
come yet; sometimes the answer is given to us to
spoil it or use as we please, just as the mother gives
the child five cents in answer to his coaxing, and
the hap or mishap of it is in his hands. Perhaps
He has given you the wheat, and you must grind
it and bake it into bread; be careful how you grind
and how you knead and bake! To some people,
like Sue Greyson, He gives bread ready baked, but
you can receive more, and therefore to you He
gives more—more opportunity and more discipline.
To be born with a talent for discipline, Tessa, is a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>
wonderful gift, and oh, how such have to be taught!
Would you rather be like flighty Sue?”
</p>
<p>
“No, oh, no, indeed,” shivered Tessa, “but she
can go to sleep when I have to lie awake.”
</p>
<p>
“Now I must go.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll walk to the end of the planks with you.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa was too much moved to care to talk; the
walk with Miss Jewett was almost as silent as her
walk homeward alone.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span><a name='ch15' id='ch15'></a>XV.—SEPTEMBER.</h2>
<p>
If Miss Jewett had not been once upon a laughing
time a girl herself, she would have wondered
where the girls in Dunellen found so much to
laugh about. Nan Gerard laughed. Sue Greyson
laughed, and Tessa Wadsworth laughed; they
laughed separately, and they laughed together;
they cried separately, too, but they did not cry
together. Nan knew that it was September, because
she had planned to come to Dunellen in September;
Sue knew, because so few days remained
before her wedding-day; and Tessa knew, because
she found the September golden rod and pale, fall
daisies in her long walks towards Mayfield; she
knew it, also, because her book was copied and at
the publishers’, awaiting the decision over which
she trembled in anticipation night and day. One
morning, late in the month, she found at the post-office
a long, thick, yellow envelope, containing
two dozens of pictures; several of them she had
seen long ago in Sunday-school books, those that
were new to her, appeared cut or torn from some
book; the letter enclosed with the pictures requested
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>
her to write a couple of books and to use
those pictures.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve heard of illustrating books,” she laughed
to herself, “but it seems that I must illustrate
pictures.”
</p>
<p>
Coaxing Miss Jewett into her little parlor, she
showed her the pictures, and read aloud the letter.
</p>
<p>
“I think it is a great compliment to you,” said
the little woman, admiringly. “You do not seem
to think of that.”
</p>
<p>
“Father will think so. You and he are such
humble people, that you think me exalted! Women
have become famous before they were as old
as I.”
</p>
<p>
“You may become famous yet.”
</p>
<p>
“It isn’t in me. Genius is bold; if it were in
me, I should find some way of knowing it. My
work is such a little bit, such a poor little bit.
But I do like the letter.”
</p>
<p>
“You will be glad of it when you are old.”
</p>
<p>
“I am glad of it now.”
</p>
<p>
She read it again: the penmanship was straggling
and ugly.
</p>
<p>
“I do not know how to talk to you; you remind
me of Tryphena and Tryphosa; St. Paul would
know what to say to you. You seem to have no
worldliness in your aims. Your style is impressive.
I think that we can keep your pen busy.
Your last manuscript is still in the balance.”
</p>
<p>
“If it be found wanting, what shall I do! The
suspense wears upon me.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>
</p>
<p>
“I begin to understand why mediocrity is long-lived.
Don’t be a goose, child.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Wadsworth was at his desk; he read the
letter through twice without comment.
</p>
<p>
“Well!” she said, playing with a morsel of pink
blotting paper.
</p>
<p>
“It’s <em>beautiful</em>, daughter.”
</p>
<p>
She wondered why it did not seem so much to
her as it did to him and to Miss Jewett.
</p>
<p>
“I expect that Dine will take to authorship
next.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa’s lips were keeping a secret, for Dine was
writing a little story. When had she ever failed
to attempt the thing that Tessa had done? She
had not taken Tessa’s place in school, and had been
graduated much nearer the foot of her class than
Tessa had ever stood; still she had Tessa’s knack
of writing stories, and telling stories, and had, at
her urging, written a story for boys, which Tessa
had criticised and copied; Dinah’s penmanship
being very pretty, but not at all plain. The letter
made no allusion to the fate of Dinah’s story;
somewhat anxious about this, she slipped the bulky
envelope into her pocket and turned her face homewards.
Her winter’s work was laid out for her;
there was nothing to do but to do it.
</p>
<p>
So full was she with plans for the books that she
did not hear steps behind her and at her side until
Sue Greyson nudged her.
</p>
<p>
“Say, Tessa, turn down Market Street with me;
I have something to tell you.” The serious, startled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>
voice arrested her instantly. What new and
dreadful thing had Sue been doing now? Her
only dread was for Dr. Lake.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve been ordering things for dinner; we have
dinner at four, so I can afford to run around town
in the morning. I’m in a horrid fix and there’s
nobody to help me out.”
</p>
<p>
“What about?”
</p>
<p>
“<em>I</em> haven’t been doing any thing; it’s other people;
it’s always other people,” she said plaintively,
“somebody is always doing something to upset
my plans. You do not sympathize with me, you
never do.”
</p>
<p>
“I do not know how to sympathize with any
thing that is not straightforward and true, and
your course is rather zigzag.”
</p>
<p>
“Dr. Towne said—”
</p>
<p>
“You haven’t been talking to <em>him</em>,” interrupted
Tessa, flushing.
</p>
<p>
“No, only he called to see father and I was home
alone and he asked me what ailed me and I had to
tell him that I didn’t want to be married.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, what could he say?”
</p>
<p>
“He said, ‘Stay with your father and be a good
girl,’” laughed Sue, “the last thing I would think
of doing. Father looks so glum and says, ‘Oh, my
little girl, what shall I do without you! I wish
that fellow was at the bottom of the sea!’ So do
I, too. I don’t see why I ever promised to marry
him! I think that I must have been bereft of my
senses.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>
</p>
<p>
“Why not ask him to wait a year—you will
know your own mind—if you have any—by that
time.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, deary me! I’d be married to John Gesner
or some other old fool with money by that time!
You don’t mind being an old maid, but <em>I</em> do!”
</p>
<p>
“How do you know that I don’t mind?” Tessa
could not forbear asking.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you wouldn’t be so happy and like to do
things. I believe that I like Gerald a great deal
better any way.”
</p>
<p>
She grew frightened at Tessa’s stillness; there
was not one sympathetic line in the stern curving
of her lips.
</p>
<p>
“Have you told Dr. Lake that?”
</p>
<p>
“You needn’t cut me in two,” laughed Sue uneasily,
“men can’t <em>sue</em> women for breach of promise
can they?”
</p>
<p>
“Answer me, please.”
</p>
<p>
Sue hesitated, colored, stammered, finally confessed
in a weak voice that tried hard to be brave,
“Yes, I have! There now! You can’t hurt me!
Father said last night that if I had taken Lake he
would have given me the house and every thing
in it ‘for the old woman to keep house with,’ you
know! And then he said that it was hard for me
to leave him now that he is growing old, that he
would have to marry somebody that wouldn’t care
for him, that he never had had much pleasure in
his life, that Gerald was a good physician and they
could work together and how happy we might all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>
have been! He was mad enough though when he
first discovered that Gerald was in love with me;
he threatened to send him off. But that’s his way!
He is one thing one day and another thing the
next! And I couldn’t help it, Tessa, I really, <em>really</em>
couldn’t, but I was so homesick and just then
Gerald came in—he looked so tired, his cough has
come back, too—and when he said ‘How many
days yet, Susan?’ I said quick, before I thought,
‘I like you a hundred times better! I would rather
marry you than Stacey.’ And then he turned so
white that I thought he was dead, and he said
something, I don’t know whether it was swearing
or praying—and caught me in his arms, and said
after that he would never let me go! And then I
said—I said—I couldn’t help it—that I would write
to Stacey and send back the ring and he took it off
and tossed it out the window! I And then I made
him go and find it! Stacey can give it to some
other girl. I didn’t hurt it. I always took it off
when I swept or wet my hands. Life is so uncertain,
I thought that he might want it again.”
</p>
<p>
“Life <em>is</em> uncertain. I never realized it until this
minute.”
</p>
<p>
“Now your voice isn’t angry,” said poor Sue
eagerly. “I want you to think that I have done
right.”
</p>
<p>
“When my moral perceptions are blunted, I
will.”
</p>
<p>
“Go away, saying ‘moral perceptions.’ I don’t
know what Dr. Towne will think either. Well,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>
what’s did can’t be undid! Now Gerald says that
I sha’n’t put it off, but that I’ve got to marry him
on that day. I know that you think it is horrid,
but you never have lovers, so you don’t know! I
don’t see why, either. You are a great deal prettier
than I am. When I am tired, I am the lookingest
thing, but you always look sweet and peaceful.
Don’t you think that I ought to please father
and stay home? Why don’t you say something?
Are you struck dumb?”
</p>
<p>
“I can not understand it—yet.”
</p>
<p>
“I think that I have made it plain enough,” cried
Sue, angrily. “You must be very stupid. You like
Gerald so much—I used to be jealous—that you
ought to be glad for him!”
</p>
<p>
“I do like him. I like him so well, Sue, that I
want him to have a faithful and true wife. O, Sue!
Sue Greyson! What are you to take that man’s
life into your hands?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know what you mean. I love him, of
course! If you think so much of him, why don’t
you marry him?”
</p>
<p>
“The question is not worth a reply.”
</p>
<p>
“You ought to comfort me; I haven’t any mother,”
returned Sue, miserably.
</p>
<p>
“It is well for her that you haven’t.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t see why you can’t let me be comfortable,”
whined Sue; “every thing would be lovely
if you didn’t spoil it all. Gerald is as wild as a
lunatic. He shall write to Stacey or father shall,
or I’ll be married beforehand and send him the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>
paper. I could do it in ten days. Do come home
with me, I want you to see my wedding dress!
It’s too lovely for any thing. My travelling dress
is an elegant brown; I got brown to please Stacey,
but Gerald likes it.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s a good idea to choose a color that gentlemen
like generally; life is so uncertain.”
</p>
<p>
“So it is,” replied Sue, unconsciously. “I think
that you might congratulate me,” she added, with
her hysterical laugh. “You didn’t think that your
gold thimble would make pretty things for Dr.
Lake’s wife, did you?”
</p>
<p>
“I congratulate <em>you</em>! I hope that I may congratulate
him, in time. Dr. Lake is trying to
pour a gallon into a half pint. I hope that one
of you will die before you make each other very
miserable.”
</p>
<p>
“You mean thing,” said Sue, almost crying.
</p>
<p>
“I do not mean to hurt you, Sue, but you are
doing something that is wretched beyond words.
Don’t you care at all for that poor fellow who loves
you?”
</p>
<p>
“Gerald loves me, too,” she answered proudly.
“You are ugly to me, and I haven’t any body that
I dare talk to but you. Mary Sherwood says that
telling you things is like throwing things into the
sea; nobody ever finds them.”
</p>
<p>
“I must be very full of rubbish.”
</p>
<p>
“We are going to Washington on our bridal
trip; we can’t stay long, for father will not spare
Gerald. I shall ask nobody but Dr. Towne and his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>
mother, and Miss Jewett, and you, and Dine. Will
you come?” she asked hesitatingly.
</p>
<p>
“I will come for Dr. Lake’s sake.”
</p>
<p>
“I got a letter from Stacey this morning. I
haven’t opened it yet; it will make me very sad.
I wish that I wasn’t so sensitive about things. It’s
a dreadful trouble to me. I looked in the glass the
first thing this morning expecting that my hair
would be all white. I’m dying to show you my
things; do come home with me.”
</p>
<p>
“Sue, do you ever say your prayers?”
</p>
<p>
“To be sure I do,” she replied, with a startled
emphasis.
</p>
<p>
“Then be sure to say them before you write to
that poor fellow.”
</p>
<p>
“I wish that you would write for me. Will you
come the night before and stay all night with me?
I shall be so afraid that the roof will tumble in, or
somebody come down the chimney to catch me,
that I sha’n’t sleep a wink.”
</p>
<p>
The curves of Tessa’s lips relented. “Yes, I will
come. If somebody come they shall catch me, too.”
</p>
<p>
“You are a darling, after all. We are to be married
about noon; Day is to send in the breakfast
and the waiters—that <em>was</em> the plan, and if father
isn’t <em>too</em> mad, I suppose he’ll do the same now.”
</p>
<p>
She stood still at the corner. “Well, if I do not
see you—good-by till the last night of your girlhood.”
</p>
<p>
“Last night of my girlhood,” repeated Sue.
“What are the other hoods?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>
</p>
<p>
“Womanhood.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes, and <em>widowhood</em>,” she said lightly.
</p>
<p>
Tessa turned the corner and walked rapidly
along the pavement. “Motherhood,” she was thinking,
“the sweetest hood of all! But I can sooner
think of that in connection with a monkey or a
butterfly than with Sue.”
</p>
<p>
At the next corner another interruption faced
her in the forms of Mary Sherwood and laughing
Naughty Nan.
</p>
<p>
The lively chat was ended with an expostulation
from Nan. “Now, Mary Sherwood, hurry. You
know that I must do several things this afternoon.
I’m going to Mayfield and Green Valley with the
handsome black bear, Miss Wadsworth.”
</p>
<p>
It was the day for her afternoon with Mrs. Towne;
it had chanced that she had given to her every
Tuesday afternoon. It touched her to find the
white-haired, feeble, old lady watching for her at
the window. Tessa loved her because she was cultured
and beautiful; she loved her voice, her shapely,
soft hands, her pretty motions, her elegant and
becoming dress, and because—O, foolish Tessa, for
a reason that she had tossed away, scorning herself—she
was Ralph Towne’s mother. Not once in
all these times had she met Dr. Towne in his own
home; not until this afternoon in which he was to
take Miss Gerard driving.
</p>
<p>
“My mother is engaged with callers, Miss Tessa;
she asked me to take you to her sitting-room, and
to take care of you for half an hour.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>
</p>
<p>
“I am sorry to trouble you,” said she confusedly.
“I want to see Miss Jewett; I will return in half
an hour.”
</p>
<p>
“And not give me the pleasure of the half hour?
When have you and I had half an hour together?”
</p>
<p>
She remembered.
</p>
<p>
“On the last night of the old year, was it not?
Come with me and ‘take off your things.’ Isn’t
that the thing to say?”
</p>
<p>
Unwillingly she followed him; he wheeled a
chair into one of the wide windows overlooking
the Park, laid away hat, sacque, and gloves, then
seated himself lazily in the chair that he had
wheeled to face her own. It was almost like the
afternoons in the shabby parlor at home; so like
them that she could not at first lift her eyes; in a
mirror into which she had glanced, she had noticed
how very pale lips and cheeks were and how dark
her eyes were glowing.
</p>
<p>
He bent forward in a professional manner and
laid two fingers on her throbbing wrist. “Miss
Tessa, what are you doing to lose flesh so?”
</p>
<p>
With that, she lifted her eyes, the color coming
with a rush. “Wouldn’t you like to see my tongue,
too?”
</p>
<p>
“I know your tongue; it has a sharp point.”
</p>
<p>
“I am sorry.”
</p>
<p>
“No you are not,” he answered settling himself
back in an easy position, and taking a penknife
from his pocket to play with. The small knife,
with the pearl handle; how often she had seen that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>
in his fingers. “You are a student, of human nature;
tell me what you think of me.”
</p>
<p>
How could she give to that amused assurance
the bare, ugly truth!
</p>
<p>
“How many times have you changed your mind
about me?”
</p>
<p>
“Once, only once.”
</p>
<p>
“Then your first impression of me was not
correct.”
</p>
<p>
With her usual directness, she answered, “No.”
</p>
<p>
The blade snapped. If she had seen but his face
she would have supposed that he had cut himself.
She hastened to speak: “Some one says that we
must change our minds three times before we can
be sure.”
</p>
<p>
“But I do not want to wait until you are sure.”
</p>
<p>
“I am sure now.”
</p>
<p>
“No doubt. Tell me now.”
</p>
<p>
How many times his irresistibly boyish manner
had forced from her words that she had afterward
sorely regretted!
</p>
<p>
“You will not be pleased. You will dislike me
forever after.”
</p>
<p>
“Much you will care for that.”
</p>
<p>
“Shall I not?” smiling at the humor in his eyes.
“I think that I do not care as I once did for what
people think of me; the question nowadays is what
I think of them.”
</p>
<p>
“I will remember,” he said urgently, “that I
brought it all upon my own head.”
</p>
<p>
How could he guess that in her heart was lodged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span>
one unpleasant thought of him? Had she not a little
while—such a little while since—cared so much
for him that he was grieved for her?
</p>
<p>
“You must promise not to be cross.”
</p>
<p>
“I promise,” taking out his watch. “You may
hammer at me for twenty minutes. I have an engagement
at half past three.”
</p>
<p>
Did Nan Gerard care as she had cared once?
Would the sound of his wheels be to Naughty Nan
what they were to her a year ago? A blue and
gold edition of Longfellow was laid open on its
face on the broad window-sill; she ran her forefinger
the length of both covers before she could
temper her voice; she did not wish to speak coldly,
and yet her heart was very cold towards him.
</p>
<p>
“I think that you took me by surprise at first;
I thought you were the handsomest man in the
world—”
</p>
<p>
“You have changed that opinion?” he said,
laughing.
</p>
<p>
“Yes; I should not think of describing you as
handsome now; I should simply say that you were
tall, dark, with deep-set, not remarkable, brown
eyes, a quiet manner, given to few words—not at
all remarkable, you are aware.”
</p>
<p>
“Go on, I am not demolished yet.”
</p>
<p>
“Your spirit I created out of my own fancies; I
gave you in those enthusiastic days a heart like a
woman’s heart, and a perfect intellect. You were
my Sir Galahad, until I knew that some things
you said were not—quite true?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>
</p>
<p>
“Not quite true!” he repeated huskily.
</p>
<p>
Her eyes as well as her fingers were on the blue
covers.
</p>
<p>
“Not true as I meant truth. Your words did
not mean to you what they meant to me—I beg
your pardon; do not let me savor of strong-mindedness,
but I speak from my heart to your heart.
You asked me a question frankly, I have answered
it frankly. You said some things to Sue that you
ought not to have said and that hurt me; I began
to feel that you are not sincere through and through
and through. At first I believed wholly in you
and then I believed not at all. I was very bitter.
And it hurt me so that I would rather have died.”
</p>
<p>
Her tone was as cold and even as if she were reciting
a theorem in <em>Legendre</em>.
</p>
<p>
“So you died because you were not true, but you
did not go to heaven because you had never lived,
and therefore I can not expect to find you again.
I did not know before how sad such a burial is.”
</p>
<p>
“Why can not you expect to find me again?”
</p>
<p>
“To find what? That fancy? If there is any
one in the world as good, as true, as strong, gentle
and sympathetic as my ideal, I surely hope to find
that he is in the world.”
</p>
<p>
“You thought that his name was Ralph Towne,
and now you know that his name is not Ralph
Towne.”
</p>
<p>
“I do not know what his name may be.”
</p>
<p>
“You think the real Ralph Towne is a stranger
not worth knowing?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>
</p>
<p>
“He is a stranger, certainly; whether or not he
is worth knowing you know best.”
</p>
<p>
She laughed, but not the suspicion of a smile
gleamed in his eyes; she had forgotten that they
could be as dark and stern as this.
</p>
<p>
“Time will show you, Miss Tessa,” he said humbly.
</p>
<p>
“I <em>am</em> sharp. I did not mean to be. But it cuts
me so when I think that you can flirt with girls
like Sue and Miss Gerard. Do you know of what
it reminds me? Once the enemy fell upon the
rear of an army and smote all that were feeble,
when they were faint and weary; it was an army
of women and little children, as well as men, and
they did not go forth to war; all they asked was a
peaceable passage through the land.”
</p>
<p>
The door was pushed softly open; Tessa lifted
her eyes to behold the rare vision of shining gray
silk, and real lace, a fine face crowned with white
braids and lighted by the softest and brownest of
brown eyes.
</p>
<p>
“My dear.” All her motherhood was concentrated
in the two worn-out words.
</p>
<p>
“Now you may run away, Ralph.”
</p>
<p>
“I am very glad to,” he said. “Good afternoon,
Miss Tessa.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa could not trust her voice to speak; raising
her eyes she met his fully as he turned at the door
to speak to his mother; a long searching look on
both sides; neither smiled.
</p>
<p>
“Tessa, have you been quarrelling with my boy?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>
</p>
<p>
“No, ma’am.”
</p>
<p>
“Has he been quarrelling with you?”
</p>
<p>
“No, ma’am.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Towne seated herself in the chair that Dr.
Towne had vacated, arranged her dress and folded
her hands in her lap.
</p>
<p>
“It is Nan Gerard again! What a flirt that girl
is! She called yesterday and Ralph chanced to
come in while she was here; she gave him such an
invitation to invite her to drive with him that he
could not—that is, he did not—refuse. I wish that
he wouldn’t, sometimes; but he says that he is
amused and no one is harmed. I am not so sure
of that. I do not understand Miss Gerard. I think
that I do not understand girls of this generation.
But I understand you.”
</p>
<p>
“I wish that you would teach me to be as
wise.”
</p>
<p>
“You will be by and by. Do you know what I
would like to ask you to promise?”
</p>
<p>
“I can not imagine.”
</p>
<p>
“I have studied you. If you will give yourself
five years to think, to grow, you will marry at
thirty the man that you would refuse to-day. You
are impetuous to-day, you form your judgments
rashly, you despise what you can not understand,
and you are not yet capable of the love that hopeth
all things, endureth all things, that suffereth long
and is <em>kind</em>.”
</p>
<p>
“That is true; I am not capable of it. I have no
patience with myself, nor with others.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>
</p>
<p>
“If you will wait these five years, your life and
another life might be more blessed.”
</p>
<p>
“Mrs. Towne! No one loves me. There is no
occasion for me not to wait. I could promise without
the least difficulty for the happiness or unhappiness
of marriage is as unattainable to me to-day
as the happiness or unhappiness of old age.”
</p>
<p>
“I will not ask you to promise, my daughter,
but I will ask you to promise this; before
you say to any man, ‘Yes,’ will you come to me
and talk it all out to me? As if I were really
your mother!”
</p>
<p>
Tessa promised with misty eyes.
</p>
<p>
“I promised to show you an old jewel-case this
afternoon,” said Mrs. Towne in a lighter tone. “I
wish that I might tell you the history of each
piece.” She brought the box from a small table
and pushed her chair nearer Tessa that she might
open it in her lap. “This emerald is for you,” she
said, slipping a ring containing an emerald in old-fashioned
setting upon the first finger of Tessa’s
left hand; “and it means what you have promised.
All that your mother will permit me, I give to you
this hour.”
</p>
<p>
“You are very kind to me.”
</p>
<p>
“I am very kind to myself. All my life I have
wanted a daughter like you: a girl with blue eyes
and a pure heart; one who would not care to flirt
and dress, but who would love me and talk to me
as you talk to me. I am proud of my boy, but I
want a daughter.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span>
</p>
<p>
“I am not very good; you may be disappointed
in me.”
</p>
<p>
“I do not fear that. This, my mother gave me,”
lifting pin and ear-rings from the box. A diamond
set in silver formed the centre of the pin; the diamond
was surrounded by pearls of different sizes.
“I was very proud of this pin. I did not know
then that I could not have every thing in the world
and out of it. This pin my father gave me.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa laid it in her hand and counted the diamonds;
it was a diamond with nine opals radiating
from it, between each opal a small diamond. “It
looks like a dahlia,” she said. “I love pretty things.
This ring is the first ring that I ever had.”
</p>
<p>
“People say that the emerald means success in
love,” replied Mrs. Towne. “I did not remember
it when I chose that for you. Perhaps you would
prefer a diamond.”
</p>
<p>
“I like best what you chose,” said Tessa, taking
from among the jewels, bracelet, pin, ear-rings and
chatelaine of turquoises and pearls, and examining
each piece with interested eyes. “These are old,
too.”
</p>
<p>
“Every thing in this box is old. Some day you
shall see my later jewels. You will like this,” she
added, placing in her hands a bracelet formed of a
network of iron wire, clasped with a medallion of
Berlin iron on a steel plate; the necklace that
matched it was also of medallions; the one in the
centre held a bust of Psyche; upon the others were
busts of men and women whom Tessa did not recognize;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span>
to this set belonged comb, pin, and ear-rings.
</p>
<p>
“These belonged to my mother. How old they
are I do not know. See this ring, a portrait of
Washington, painted on copper, and covered with
glass. It is said to be one of the finest portraits in
the country. I used to wear it a great deal. My
father gave it to me on my fifteenth birthday.
Have I told you that Lafayette kissed me when I
was an infant in my mother’s arms?”
</p>
<p>
While Tessa replaced the treasures with fingers
that lingered over them, with the new weight of
the emerald upon her finger, and the new weight
of a promise upon her heart, Mrs. Towne related
the story of the kiss from Lafayette.
</p>
<p>
Tessa was a perfect listener, Mrs. Towne thought;
the lighting or darkening of her eyes, a flush rising
to her cheeks now and then, the curving of the
mobile lips, an exclamation of surprise or appreciation,
were most grateful to the old heart that had
found after long and intense waiting the daughter
that she could love and honor.
</p>
<p>
In the late twilight Dr. Towne returned; Tessa
was still listening, with the jewel-case in her
lap.
</p>
<p>
“I have missed my husband with all the old
loneliness since we came into Dunellen,” she was
saying when her tall son entered and stood at her
side.
</p>
<p>
“Mother,” he said, in the shy way that Tessa
knew, “you forget that you have me.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>
</p>
<p>
“No, son, I do not forget; but your life is full of
new interests. Yesterday I did not have ten minutes
alone with you.”
</p>
<p>
“It shall not happen again.”
</p>
<p>
“I have persuaded Tessa to stay and hear Philip
to-night; she says that he is like a west wind to
her.”
</p>
<p>
“He would not fall upon the hindmost in your
army, Miss Tessa.”
</p>
<p>
“I am sure that he would not.”
</p>
<p>
“Not if they coaxed him to?”
</p>
<p>
“He should have manliness enough to resist all
their pretty arts, and enticing ways.”
</p>
<p>
“Mother, can’t you convince her? She has been
rating me soundly for flirting, when it is the girls
that are flirting with me.”
</p>
<p>
“It takes two to flirt,” replied his mother.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Towne was sent for as they were rising from
the dinner table; Mrs. Towne and Tessa crossed the
Park alone; at the entrance of the Lecture Room
Sue Greyson met them.
</p>
<p>
“I <em>had</em> to come,” Sue whispered, seizing Tessa’s
arm. “Father is so horrid and hateful, and said awful
things to me just because I asked <em>him</em> to write
to Stacey. The letter is written anyhow, and I’m
thankful it’s over. Father says that he won’t give
me the house, and that I sha’n’t be married under
his roof. He is mad with Gerald, too, and told
him to leave his house. So Gerald left and went
to see a patient. He is so happy that he don’t care
what father says.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span>
</p>
<p>
As they passed down the aisle, Tessa’s dress
brushed against Felix Harrison; he was sitting
alone with his father.
</p>
<p>
“Why! Felix Harrison! Did you ever?” whispered
irrepressible Sue.
</p>
<p>
The Lecture Room was well-lighted, and well-filled.
Professor Towne was the fashion in Dunellen.
During the opening prayer there was a stir
in one of the pews behind Tessa; she did not lift
her head, her heart beat so rapidly that she felt as
if she were suffocating.
</p>
<p>
“Poor fellow,” came in Sue’s loud whisper close
to her ear. “They have taken him out! I should
think that he would know better than to go among
folks.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa could not follow the speaker for some minutes;
the lights went out, she could not catch her
breath; Mrs. Towne took her hand and held it
firmly, then the lights came dim, through a misty
and waving distance, her breath was drawn more
easily, she could discern the outline of the preacher,
and then his dark face was brought fully into view,
his voice sounded loud in her ears; for some time
longer she could not catch and connect his words;
then, clear and strong, the words fell from his lips,
and she could listen and understand—
</p>
<p>
“Good is the will of the Lord concerning me.”
</p>
<p>
If Felix could have listened and understood, would
he have been comforted, too?
</p>
<p>
His voice held her when her attention wavered;
afterward, that one sentence was all that had fastened
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>
itself; and was not that enough for one life
time?
</p>
<p>
At the door, Dr. Towne stood waiting for his
mother, and Mr. Hammerton and Dinah were moving
towards the group.
</p>
<p>
“I knew that you would be here,” said Dinah,
“so I coaxed Gus away from father. I couldn’t
wait to tell you that your books have come. Two
splendid dozens in all colors; I had to open them.
You don’t mind? Gus and I each read a brown
one; we think the crimson and blue ones must be
splendid.”
</p>
<p>
Sue drew Tessa aside to coax in her plaintively
miserable voice, “Come home with me; father will
say things, and I shall be afraid.”
</p>
<p>
“I can’t help you, Sue.”
</p>
<p>
“You mean you <em>won’t</em>. I’ll elope with Dr. Lake,
and then Dunellen will be on fire, and you don’t
care.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m not afraid. He has good sense, if you
haven’t.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll come and see you to-morrow, then.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, that will do.”
</p>
<p>
“Nobody ever had so much trouble before,” sighed
Sue as she went off.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Hammerton was in high glee and teased
Tessa all the way home about her book.
</p>
<p>
“The milk pails were on the fence twice, Lady
Blue, that is tautology.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, they kept them there.”
</p>
<p>
“And the grandmother was always knitting.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>
</p>
<p>
“She always did knit.”
</p>
<p>
“Lady Blue, you are on the road to Poverty; he
who walks the streets of Literature will stop at the
house of Starvation. Homer was a beggar; Terence
was a slave; Tasso was a poor man; Bacon was as
poor as a church mouse; Cervantes died of nothing
to eat. Are you not beginning to feel the pangs of
hunger? Breath and memory fail me, or I would
convince you. Collins died of neglect; Milton was
an impecunious genius; every body knows how
wretchedly poor Goldsmith was; and wasn’t poor
old prodigious Sam Johnson hungry half his life?
Chatterton destroyed himself. I tremble for you,
child of Genius! Author of ‘Under the Wings,’
what hast thou to say in defence of thy mad
career?”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t mind him, Tessa,” consoled Dinah, “he
does like your book; he said that he had no idea
that you could do so well; that there was great
promise in it, that it revealed a thoughtful mind—he
said it to father—that the delineation of character
was fine, and that it had the real thing in it.
What is the real thing?”
</p>
<p>
“Read it and you will know.”
</p>
<p>
“If it isn’t asking too much,” began Tessa, timidly,
“I wish that <em>you</em> would write me a criticism,
Gus. I like the way that you talk about books.
Not many know how to read a book, and still fewer
know how to talk about it. Will you, please?”
</p>
<p>
“You overrate my judgment; sentiment is not in
my line; I have done my share in reading books; I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span>
do not know that I have got much out of them all.
My own literary efforts would be like this:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Here&nbsp;&nbsp;lies—and&nbsp;&nbsp;more’s&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;pity!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All&nbsp;&nbsp;that&nbsp;&nbsp;remains&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas&nbsp;&nbsp;New-city.’<br />
</p>
<p>
“His name was Newtown.”
</p>
<p>
Dinah gave her little shout.
</p>
<p>
“Then you will not promise,” said Tessa, disappointedly.
“I’m not afraid of sharp criticism; I
want to do my poor little best; I do not expect to
do as much as the girls in books who write stories.
I do not expect any publisher to fall in love with
me as he did in <em>St. Elmo</em>, wasn’t it?”
</p>
<p>
“What <em>do</em> you expect to do?”
</p>
<p>
“I hope—perhaps that is the better word—to give
others all the good that is given me; I believe that
if one has the ‘gift of utterance’ even in so small a
fashion as I have it, that experiences will be given
to utter; the Divine Biographer writes the life for
the human heart to read, interpret and put into
words! And to them is given a peculiar life, or, it
may be, a peculiar appreciation of life; heartaches
go hand in hand with headaches.
</p>
<p>
“I was born into my home that I may write my
books; my poor little books, my little, weak, crooked-backed
children! Would Fredrika Bremer have
written her books without her exceptional home-training,
or Sara Coleridge, or any other of the
lesser lights shine as they do shine, if the spark
had not been blown upon by the breath of their
home-fires? When I am sorry sometimes that I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span>
can not do what I would and go where I would, I
think that I have not gathered together all the
fragments that are around loose between the plank
walk and the soldiers’ monument! Said mother,
‘<em>How</em> do you make a book? Do you take a little
from this book and a little from that?’”
</p>
<p>
“What did you say?” asked Dine.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I said that I took a tone from her voice, an
expression from father’s eyes, a curl from your head,
a word from Gus’s lips, a laugh from Sue Greyson,
a sigh from Dr. Lake, an apple blossom from Mr.
Bird’s orchard, a spray of golden rod from the wayside,
a chat from loungers in the Park, a wise saying
from Miss Jewett—”
</p>
<p>
“That’s rather a conglomeration,” said Dinah.
</p>
<p>
“That is life, as I see it and live it.”
</p>
<p>
“What do you take from yourself?” asked Mr.
Hammerton.
</p>
<p>
“I have all my life from the time that I cried
over my first lie and prayed that I might have
curly hair, to the present moment, when I am
glad and sorry about a thousand things.”
</p>
<p>
“What did mother say?”
</p>
<p>
“She said that any one could write a book, then.”
</p>
<p>
“Let her try, then! It’s awful hard about the
grammar and spelling and the beginning a chapter
and ending it and introducing people!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, it’s awful hard or awful easy,” replied Mr.
Hammerton. “Which is it, Lady Blue?”
</p>
<p>
“Ask me when I have written my novel! Did
you hear from the afternoon mail, Dine?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said Dine, grimly, “I should think I <em>did</em>
hear. Mother and I have had a fight! Father
took care of the wounded and we are all convalescing.
Aunt Theresa has written for one of us to
come next week; kindly says that she will take me
if mother can not spare you; I said right up and
down that <em>I</em> wouldn’t go, and mother said right
down and up that I <em>should</em> go, that she couldn’t and
wouldn’t spare you! Aunt Theresa has the rheumatism,
and it’s horrid dull on a farm! I was there
when I was a little girl, and she sent me to bed before
dark; I’m afraid that she will do it again; if
she does I’ll frighten her out of her rheumatics.
Mother will not let you have a voice in the matter,
Tessa; who knows but you might meet your
fate? The school-teacher boards with them; he is
just out of college. Mother sha’n’t make me go!”
</p>
<p>
“I do not choose to go; but I could have all my
time to myself. A low, cosy chamber and a fire
on the hearth, no one to intrude or hinder.”
</p>
<p>
“But the school-master!” added Mr. Hammerton.
</p>
<p>
“He’s only a boy; I could put him into my book.”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll draw lots; shall we?”
</p>
<p>
“If mother is determined, the lot is drawn.”
</p>
<p>
“And father wants you, I know; he had an attack
of pain before tea. I wish that I was useful
and couldn’t be spared.”
</p>
<p>
“May I not have a vote; I am a naturalized
member of the family?”
</p>
<p>
“You would want Tessa, too,” said Dinah.
</p>
<p>
“Would I?” he returned, squeezing the gloved
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span>
fingers on his arm, whereupon Dinah became confused
and silent.
</p>
<p>
Tessa found her books upon the hall table; her
father, Mr. Hammerton, and Dinah followed her
into the hall to watch her face and laugh over
her exclamations.
</p>
<p>
“Your secret is out,” cried her father; “at Christmas
there will be a placard in Runyon’s with the
name of the book and author in flaming red letters! You can not remain the Great Unknown.”
</p>
<p>
“I feel so ashamed of trying,” said Tessa, with
a brown cover, a red cover, and a green cover in
her hands, “but I had to. I’ll be too humble to
be ashamed. ‘Humility’s so good when pride’s
impossible.’”
</p>
<p>
Several copies were taken up-stairs; Miss Jewett’s
name was written in one, Mrs. Towne’s in
another, Mr. Hammerton’s in one that he had selected,
and in one, bound in a sober gray, she
wrote,
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
“<span class='sc'>Felix Harrison</span>. In memory of the old school
days when he helped me with my compositions.
</p>
<p style='text-align:right; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; margin-right:2em;;'>“T. L. W.”</p>
<p>
She never knew of his sudden, sharp cry over it:
“Oh, my life! my lost life! my wasted life!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span><a name='ch16' id='ch16'></a>XVI.—A TANGLE.</h2>
<p>
Mrs. Wadsworth’s strong will triumphed, as it
usually did, and Dinah was sent into the country
early in the last week of September, with a promise
from Tessa that she would release her from her
durance as soon as one of her books was finished
and herself spend the remainder of the winter with
the childless old people who had been looking forward
to this pleasure from winter to winter ever
since Tessa was ten years old. Half Dunellen had
pacified Dinah with the promise of long weekly
letters, and she knew that Tessa and her father
would write often. “I am not strong enough to
write letters,” her mother had said. “Tessa will
tell you every thing.” “I will add a postscript
whenever Tessa will permit,” said Mr. Hammerton,
which queerly enough consoled homesick Dinah
more than all the other promises combined.
</p>
<p>
Sue had not come to talk to Tessa and she dared
not go to Dr. Greyson’s for fear of influencing her.
She had met Dr. Lake once; he had lifted his hat
with a flourish, but would not stop to speak to her.
</p>
<p>
And now it was Wednesday and Sue’s wedding
day had been set for Friday.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span>
</p>
<p>
At noon, among other letters, her father brought
her a note from Felix Harrison:
</p>
<p>
“I must see you; I want to talk to you. Come
Wednesday afternoon.”
</p>
<p>
How she shrank from this interview she did not
understand until she could think it over years afterward.
In those after years when she said, “I do
not want to live my life over again,” she remembered
her experiences with Felix Harrison; more
than all, the feeling of those weeks when she had
felt <em>bound</em>. It was also in her mind when she said,
as she often did say, in later life, “I could never influence
any one to marry.” How often an expression
in the mature years of a woman’s life would
reveal a long story, if one could but read it.
</p>
<p>
Another word of hers in her middle age, “I love
to help little girls to be happy,” was the expression
to years of longing that no one had ever guessed;
her mother least of all.
</p>
<p>
But she had not come to this settled time yet; it
was weary years before she was at leisure from herself.
It was Wednesday noon now and Felix had
sent for her; she shrank from him with a shrinking
amounting to terror; he would touch her hand,
most certainly, and he might put his arm around
her and kiss her; she would faint and fall at his
feet if he did; he might say that she had promised
him, that she was bound to him, that he would
never let her go; that he was gaining strength and
that she must become his wife or he would die!
</p>
<p>
Why could he not write his message? What
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span>
could he have to say to her? Was it not all said
and laid away to be remembered, perhaps, and that
was all? Then the memory of the old Felix swept
over her, and she bowed her head and wept for him!
She had held herself in her heart as his promised
wife for six long weeks, how could she shrink from
him? Was he not to her what no other man would
ever become? Was she not to him the one best
and dearest?
</p>
<p>
“I wonder,” she sobbed, “why <em>he</em> had to be the
one to love me; why was not the love given to one
whom I could love? Why must such a good and
perfect gift as love be a burden to him and to me?
If some one I know—”
</p>
<p>
The cheeks that were wet for Felix Harrison
burned at the thought of one she knew!
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I wonder—but I must not wonder—I must
be submissive; I must bow before the Awful Will.”
</p>
<p>
In that hour it was harder to bear for Felix
Harrison to love her than for Ralph Towne to be
indifferent.
</p>
<p>
“What are you going to do this afternoon?”
inquired her mother at the dinner table.
</p>
<p>
“Take my walk! And then the thing that comes
first”
</p>
<p>
“You never have any plan about any thing; any
one with so little to do ought to have a plan.”
</p>
<p>
“My plan is this—<em>do the next thing</em>! I find that
it keeps me busy.”
</p>
<p>
“The next thing, hard or easy,” said Mr. Wadsworth.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247'></a>247</span>
</p>
<p>
“Hard! Easy!” repeated Mrs. Wadsworth in
her ironical voice. “Tessa never had a hard thing
to do in her life. It will be my comfort in my last
hours, Tessa, that you have been kept from troubles
and disappointments.”
</p>
<p>
“You might as well take the comfort of it now,”
said Tessa.
</p>
<p>
“Not many young women of your age have
your easy life,” her mother continued; “you have
no thought where your next meal will come from,
or where you will live in your old age, or where—”
</p>
<p>
“I know where all my good things come from,”
interrupted Tessa, reverently; “the how, the when,
and the what that I do not know—that I am waiting
to know.”
</p>
<p>
“That is like you! Not a thought, not a care;
it will come dreadful hard to you if you ever <em>do</em>
have trouble.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa’s tears ever left in her heart a place for
sweet laughter; so light, so soft, so submissive, and
withal so happy was the low laugh of her reply
that her father’s eyes filled at the sound. Somebody
understood her.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Wadsworth looked annoyed. Her elder
daughter’s words baffled her. Tessa <em>was</em> shallow
and she sighed and asked her if she would take
apple pie.
</p>
<p>
Tessa ate her pie understanding how she was a
trial to her mother, but not understanding how she
could hinder it. Could she change herself? or
could her mother change herself?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248'></a>248</span>
</p>
<p>
“I wish that it were easier for me to love people,”
she said coming out of a reverie, “then I
would not need to trouble myself about not understanding
them.”
</p>
<p>
“I thought that you were a student of human
nature,” said her father.
</p>
<p>
“I always knew that she couldn’t see through
people,” exclaimed her mother.
</p>
<p>
“I do not; I never know when I am deceived.”
</p>
<p>
“My rule is,” Mr. Wadsworth arose and stood behind
his chair, “to judge people by themselves and
not by <em>myself</em>.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, the heartaches that would save,” thought
Tessa. At the hour when she was walking slowly
towards Felix, her black dress brushing the grass,
her eyes upon the harvested fields lying warm in
the mellow sunlight, and on her lips the sorrowful
wonder, he was sitting alone in the summer-house,
his head dropped within his hands. He was wondering,
too, as all his being leaped forward at the
thought of her coming, and battling with the strong
love that was too strong for his feeble strength.
</p>
<p>
When her hand unlatched the gate, he was not
in the summer-house; she walked up the long path,
and around to the latticed porch where Laura liked
to sew or read in the afternoons; there was no one
there; the work-basket had been pushed over, cotton
and thimble had rolled to the edge of the floor,
the white work had been thrown over a chair,
she stood a moment in the oppressive silence,
trembling and half leaning against a post; the tall
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249'></a>249</span>
clock in the hall ticked loudly and evenly: forever—never,
never—forever! Her heart quickened,
every thing grew dark like that night in the lecture-room,
she was possessed with a terror that
swept away breath and motion. A groan, then
another and another, interrupted the never—forever,
of the clock, then a step on the oil-cloth of
the hall, and she dimly discerned Laura’s frightened
face, and heard as if afar off her surprised voice:
“Why, Tessa! O, Tessa, I am so glad!”
</p>
<p>
The frightened face was held up to be kissed and
arms were clinging around her.
</p>
<p>
“I’m always just as frightened every time—he
was in the summer-house and father found him—he
can speak now—it doesn’t last very long.”
</p>
<p>
“I will not stay, he needs you.”
</p>
<p>
“Not now, no one can help him; father is with
him. If this keeps on Dr. Greyson says that some
day he will have to be undressed and dressed just
like an infant. He has been nervous all day, as if
he were watching for something. O, Tessa, I want
to die, I want him to die, I can’t bear it any longer.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa’s only reply was her fast dropping tears.
</p>
<p>
“If he only had a mother,” said Laura; “I want
him to have a mother now that he can never have
a wife! If he only had been married, his wife
would have clung to him, and loved him, and
taken care of him. Don’t you think that God
might have waited to bring this upon him until
he was married?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no, no, <em>no!</em>” shivered Tessa; “we do not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250'></a>250</span>
know the best times for trouble to come. I shall
always believe that after this.”
</p>
<p>
“He always liked you better than any one; do
you know that he has a picture of you taken when
we went to the Institute? You have on a hat and
sacque, and your school books are in your hand.”
</p>
<p>
“I remember that picture! Has he kept it all
this time?”
</p>
<p>
“If he asks for you—he will hear your voice—will
you go in?”
</p>
<p>
“No, I can not see him,” she answered nervously.
</p>
<p>
“Then I will walk down to the gate with you.
He will be sure to ask, and I do not like to refuse
him.”
</p>
<p>
Walking slowly arm in arm as they used to walk
from school years ago, they passed down the path,
at first, speaking only of Felix, and then as they
neared the gate, falling into light talk about Laura’s
work, the new servant who was so kind to Felix,
the plants that Laura had taken into the sitting-room,
“to make it cosy for Felix this winter,” the
shirts that she had cut out for him and their father,
and intended to make on the machine; about the
sewing society that was to meet to-morrow, a book
that Felix was reading aloud evenings while their
father dozed and she sewed, some Mayfield gossip
about Dr. Towne, and their plan of taking Felix
travelling next summer. Tessa listened and replied.
She never had any thing to say about herself.
Laura thought with Mrs. Wadsworth that
Tessa had never had any “experiences.” Miss Jewett
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251'></a>251</span>
and Tessa’s father knew; but it was not because
she had told them. What other people chattered
about to each other she kept for her prayers.
</p>
<p>
Laura cried a little when Tessa kissed her at the
gate. “I wish that you wouldn’t go; I want you to
stay and help me. Will you come again soon?”
</p>
<p>
“I can’t,” she answered hurriedly.
</p>
<p>
“Did Felix know that you were coming to-day?”
</p>
<p>
Tessa’s eyes made answer enough; too much, for
Laura understood.
</p>
<p>
“I will not tell him that I know—but I had
guessed it—I heard him praying once while we
were away, and I knew that he was giving up <em>you</em>.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa kissed her again, and without a word hurried
away, walking with slower steps as she went
on with her full eyes bent upon the ground.
</p>
<p>
Was it so much to give up Tessa Wadsworth?
What <em>was</em> she that she could make such a difference
in a man’s life? Was she lovable, after all,
despite her quick words and sharp speeches? She
was not pretty like Dinah, or “taking” like Sue;
it was very pleasant to be loved for her own sake;
“my own unattractive self,” she said. It would be
very pleasant in that far-off time, when she reviewed
her life, to remember that some one had
loved her beside her father and Dine and Miss
Jewett! And a good man, too; a man with brains,
and a pure heart!
</p>
<p>
Her ideal was a man with brains, and a pure
heart; then why had she not loved Felix Harrison?
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I don’t know,” she sighed. “I can’t understand.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252'></a>252</span>
Slowly, slowly, with her full eyes on the
ground she went on, not heeding the sound of
wheels, or gay voices, as a carriage passed her now
and then; but as she went on, with her eyes still
full for Felix, a light sound of wheels set her heart
to beating, and she lifted her eyes to bow to Dr.
Towne.
</p>
<p>
In that instant her heart bowed before the Awful
Will in acceptance of the love that had been given
to her, even as other things in her lot had been
given her, without any seeking or asking.
</p>
<p>
“I can bear it,” she felt, filling the words with
Paul’s thought, when he wrote, “I can do all
things.”
</p>
<p>
Dr. Towne drew the reins: she stood still on the
edge of the foot-path.
</p>
<p>
“My mother misses you, Miss Tessa.”
</p>
<p>
“Does she? I am sorry, but I have to be so
busy at home.”
</p>
<p>
His sympathetic eyes were on her face. “I
thought, that you were never troubled about any
thing,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“I am not—when I can help it.”
</p>
<p>
“I left Sue Greyson up the road looking for you;
I could not bring her to meet you, as my carriage
holds but one; there was news in her face.”
</p>
<p>
“Then I will go to hear.”
</p>
<p>
The light sound of his wheels had died away
before she espied Sue’s tall figure coming quickly
towards her.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Tessa! How <em>could</em> you go so far? Your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253'></a>253</span>
mother said that you were here on this road, and
that I should find you either up a tree or in the
brook; I’ve got splendid news! guess! Did you
meet Dr. Towne? He stopped and talked to me,
but I wouldn’t tell him. He and his mother will
know in time. Now, guess.”
</p>
<p>
“Let me sit down and think. It will take time.”
</p>
<p>
They had met near the brook at the corner of the
road that turned past Old Place; on the corner
stood a tall, bare walnut-tree, the gnarled roots
covered a part of the knoll under which a slim
thread of water trickled over moss and jagged flat
stones, and then found its clear way into a broader
channel and thence into the brook that crossed one
of the Old Place meadows.
</p>
<p>
These roots had been Tessa’s resting-place all
summer; how many times she had looked up to
read the advertisement of the clothier in Dunellen
painted in black letters on a square board nailed to
the trunk; how many times had she leaned back
and looked down into the thread of water at the
moss, and the pebbles, the tiny ferns and the tall
weeds, turning to look down the road towards May
field where the school-house stood, and then across
the fields—the wheat fields, the corn fields—to the
peach orchard beyond them, and beyond that the
green slope of the fertile hill-side with its few
dwellings, and above the slope the crooked green
edge that met the sky—sometimes a blue sky, sometimes
a sky of clouds, and sometimes gray with the
damp clouds hanging low; thinking, as her eyes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254'></a>254</span>
roved off her book, of some prank of Rob’s or some
quaint saying of Sadie’s, of some little comforting
thought that swelled in grandma’s patient, gentle
heart, or of something sharp that Sadie’s snappish
mother should say; sometimes she would take the
sky home for her book and sometimes the weeds
and the pebbles and the brook; and when it was
not her book it was Felix—poor Felix!—or Dr.
Lake, whom she loved more and more every day
with the love that she would have loved a naughty,
feeble, winsome child; or Mr. Towne, of his face
that was ever with her like the memory of a picture
that she had lingered before and could never
forget, or of his voice and some words that he had
spoken; or of her father and his failing strength
and brave efforts to conceal it; sometimes a kind
little thing that her mother had done for her, some
self-denial or shame-faced demonstration of her love
for her elder daughter, sometimes of Dine’s changeful
moods, and often of the book of George Eliot’s
that she was reading, or the latest of Charles Kingsley’s
that she was discussing with Mr. Hammerton;
thinking, musing, feeling, planning while she
picked up a pebble or tore a weed into bits, or
wrote a sentence in her pocket notebook! It was
no wonder that this gnarled seat was so much to
her that she lost herself and lost the words that
Sue was speaking so rapidly.
</p>
<p>
“You are not listening to me at all,” cried Sue
at last “I might as well talk to the tree as to talk
to you!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255'></a>255</span>
</p>
<p>
“I am listening; what is it?”
</p>
<p>
“It’s all settled—splendidly settled—and I’m as
happy as Cinderella when she found the Prince!
Now guess!”
</p>
<p>
“Well, then,” stooping to pick a weed that had
gone to seed, “I guess that you have come to your
right mind, that you will marry Stacey on Friday
and all will go as merry as a marriage bell
should.”
</p>
<p>
“What a thing to guess! That’s too horrid!
Guess again.”
</p>
<p>
“You have grown good and ‘steady,’ you will
keep house for your father and be what he is always
calling you,—the comfort of his old age,—and
forego lovers and such perplexities forever.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s horrider still! Do guess something sensible.”
</p>
<p>
“You are going to marry Dr. Lake. Your father
has stormed and stormed, but now he has become
mild and peaceable; you are to be married
Friday morning and start off immediately in the
sober certainty of waking bliss.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said Sue very seriously, “that is it.
Every thing is as grand as a story-book, except
that father will not give me the house for a wedding
present. Oh, those wretched days since I
saw you last! I did think that I would take laudanum
or kill myself with a penknife. You don’t
know what I have been through. Old Blue Beard
is pious to what father has been; Gerald, <em>he</em> kept
out of the house. I should have run away before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256'></a>256</span>
this, only I knew that father would come around
and beg my pardon. He always does.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa stooped to dip her fingers in the water.
</p>
<p>
“And <em>this</em> is your idea of marriage,” she said
quietly.
</p>
<p>
“No, it isn’t. I never looked forward to any
thing like this; I always wanted something better.
I am not doing very well, although I suppose
there <em>are</em> girls in Dunellen who would think
Gerald a catch.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Sue, Sue! when he loves you so! If he
could hear you, it would break his heart!”
</p>
<p>
“Take him yourself then, if you think he’s so
much,” laughed Sue. “Nan Gerard will get the
catch!”
</p>
<p>
“Sue, I am ashamed of you!” exclaimed Tessa
rising. “I am glad if you are happy—as happy as
you know how to be. I want you to be happy—and
<em>do</em> be good to Dr. Lake.”
</p>
<p>
How Sue laughed!
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you dear old Goody Goody,” she cried,
springing to her feet and throwing her arms
around Tessa. “What else should I be to my
own wedded husband? But it does seem queer
so near to Old Place to be talking about marrying
Dr. Lake.”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll remember this place always, Sue, and
that you promised to be kind to Dr. Lake.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I’ll remember,” with a shadow passing
over her face. “The next time you and I sit here
it will be all over with me. I shall be out of lovers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257'></a>257</span>
for the rest of my natural life.” She laughed and
chatted all the way home; her listener was silent
and sore at heart.
</p>
<p>
“You will come to-morrow night and see the last
of me, won’t you? This is what I came to ask
you, ‘the last sad office’ isn’t that it? Sue Greyson
will never ask you another favor.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I will come.” She had always loved Sue
Greyson. She did not often kiss her, but she kissed
her now.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t look so. Laugh, can’t you? If it is
something terrible, it isn’t happening to you.”
</p>
<p>
“The things that happen to me are the easiest
to bear.”
</p>
<p>
Sue crossed over to the planks and went on pondering
this, then gave it up to wonder how she
would wear her hair on her wedding morning;
Tessa would make it look pretty any way, for she
was born a hair-dresser.
</p>
<p>
And Tessa went in and up-stairs, thinking of a
remark of Miss Jewett’s: “I should not understand
my life at all, it would be all in a tangle, if it were
not for my prayers.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258'></a>258</span><a name='ch17' id='ch17'></a>XVII.—THE NIGHT BEFORE.</h2>
<p>
Two of the pretty crimson and brown chairs
were drawn to the back parlor grate; Sue had
kindled a fire in the back parlor because she felt
“shivery,” beside, it had rained all day; the wedding
morning promised to be chilly and rainy.
</p>
<p>
Early after tea Dr. Greyson had been called
away; Dr. Lake had not returned from a long
drive, the latest Irish girl was singing lustily in
the kitchen; Sue and Tessa were alone together
before the fire. The white shades were down, the
doors between the rooms closed, they were altogether
cozy and comfortable. Almost as comfortable,
Tessa was thinking, as if there were no dreaded
to-morrow; but then she was the only person
in the world who could see any thing to be dreaded
in the to-morrow. Tessa’s fingers were moving
in and out among the white wool that she was crocheting
into a long comforter for her father; Sue
sat idly restless looking into Tessa’s face or into
the fire.
</p>
<p>
Now and then Tessa spoke, now and then Sue
ejaculated or laughed or sighed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259'></a>259</span>
</p>
<p>
“Life is too queer for any thing,” she said reflectively.
“Don’t you know the minister said
that Sunday that we helped to make our own
lives? I have often thought of that.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa’s wool was tangled, she unknotted it without
replying.
</p>
<p>
The rain plashed against the windows, a coal fell
through the grate and dropped upon the fender.
</p>
<p>
“I wonder how Stacey feels,” said Sue. “Perhaps
he is taking out another girl to-night. That
ring was large, it will not fit a small hand; perhaps
he sold it, you can always get three quarters
the worth of a diamond, I have heard people
say.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa’s lips were not encouraging, but Sue was
not looking at her.
</p>
<p>
“Gerald has the wedding ring in his pocket; I
tried it on this noon. I wanted to wear it to get
used to it, but he wouldn’t let me. He is sentimental
like you. I expect that he is really enjoying
carrying it around in his pocket. S. G. L. is
written in it.”
</p>
<p>
The rain plashed and Tessa worked; suddenly
the door-bell gave a sharp clang, a moment later
little Miss Jewett, in a waterproof, was ushered in.
</p>
<p>
“I had to come, girls. I hope I don’t intrude.”
</p>
<p>
“Intrude!” Both of Sue’s affectionate arms were
around the wet figure. “Tessa is thinking of glum
things to say to me, do sit down and say something
funny.”
</p>
<p>
The long waterproof was unbuttoned and hung
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260'></a>260</span>
upon the hat-stand in the hall, the rubbers were
placed upon the hearth to dry, and the plump little
woman pressed into Tessa’s arm-chair. Moving
an ottoman to her side, Tessa sat with her arm upon
the arm of her chair.
</p>
<p>
“I’m <em>so</em> glad to see you,” Sue cried, dropping
into her own chair. “What a long walk you
have had in the rain just to give me some good
advice. Don’t you wish that Tessa was going off,
too?”
</p>
<p>
“Tessa will not go off till she is good and ready,”
replied Miss Jewett, “and then she will go off to
some purpose.”
</p>
<p>
“Make a good match, do you mean?”
</p>
<p>
“If she can find her match,” caressing the hand
on the arm of the chair.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Miss Jewett, tell us a story! A real love
story! Humor me just this once, this last time!
I don’t like advice and I do like love stories.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you, too, Tessa?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I shall write one some day! They shall
both be perfect and love each other perfectly. It
shall not be an earthly story, but a heavenly
one.”
</p>
<p>
“That would be too tame,” said Sue. “I should
want it to be a little wicked.”
</p>
<p>
“That would be more like life—”
</p>
<p>
“And then get good in the end! That is like
life, too,” interrupted Sue. “Now, go on, please.”
</p>
<p>
“Very well. To-night is an event, I suppose I
may as well celebrate it. I will tell you about a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261'></a>261</span>
present I had once, the most perfect gift I ever
received.”
</p>
<p>
“But I wanted a love story.”
</p>
<p>
“And you think that <em>my</em> story can not be that?
Sometimes I think that unmarried people live the
most perfect love stories.”
</p>
<p>
Lifting the mass of white wool from Tessa’s lap
and taking the needle, she worked half a minute
before she spoke; Sue’s curious, bright eyes were
on her face, Tessa’s were on the wool she was playing
with.
</p>
<p>
“Twenty-five years ago, when I was younger
than I am now, and as intense and as full of aspirations
as Tessa here, and as full of fun, as <em>you</em>,
Sue Greyson, I boarded one winter with a widow.
She was quite middle-aged and lived alone with
her chickens and cat, very comfortably off, but
she wanted a boarder or two for company. My
store was a little affair then, but I was a busy
body; I used to study and sew evenings. Ah,
those evenings! I often think them over now as
I sit alone. I shall never forget that winter. I
<em>grew</em>. The widow and I were not alone; before I
had been there a week a young man came, he was
scarcely older than I—”
</p>
<p>
Sue laughed and looked at Tessa.
</p>
<p>
“He was to sail away in the spring to some
dreadful place,—that sounds like you, Sue,—to be
a missionary!”
</p>
<p>
“A <em>missionary!</em>” exclaimed Sue.
</p>
<p>
“Every evening he read aloud to us, usually
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262'></a>262</span>
poetry or the Bible. Poetry meant something to
me then—that sounds like you, Tessa. One evening
he read Esther, one evening Ruth, and when
he read Nehemiah, oh, how enthusiastic we were!
He talked and talked and talked, and I listened
and listened and listened till all my heart went out
to meet him.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah,” cried Sue, “to think of you being in love,
Miss Jewett. I didn’t know that you were ever so
naughty!”
</p>
<p>
“At last the time came that he must go—the
very last evening. I thought that those evenings
could never end, but they did. I could hardly see
my stitches for tears; I was making over a black
bombazine for the widow, and the next evening I
had to rip my work out! He read awhile,—he was
reading <em>Rasselas</em> that night,—and then he dropped
the book and talked of his work and the life he
expected to lead.
</p>
<p>
“‘You ought to take a wife,’ said the widow.
</p>
<p>
“‘No woman will ever love me well enough to
go to such a place with me,’ he said.
</p>
<p>
“Just then I dropped the scissors and had to
bend down to pick them up. The widow went out
into the kitchen to set the sponge for her bread and
clear out the stove for morning, and we stayed alone
and talked. We talked about whether he would be
homesick and seasick, and how glad he would be of
letters from home; not that he had many friends to
write to him, though; and I sewed on and on, and
threaded my needle, and dropped my scissors, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263'></a>263</span>
almost cried because all I cared for in the wide
world would sail away with him, and he would
never know!
</p>
<p>
“‘The best of friends must part,’ he said when
she brought in his candle and lighted it for him.
</p>
<p>
“In the morning, we all arose early and took our
last breakfast together by lamplight. She shook
hands with him twice, and wished him all sorts of
good wishes, and then he held out his hand to me
and said, ‘Good-by.’ I said, ‘Good-by.’ And then
he said, ‘You have given me a very pleasant winter;
I shall often think of it.’ And I said, ‘Thank
you,’ and ran away up-stairs to cry by myself.
That was five and twenty years ago—before you
were born, Sue, and before Tessa could creep; there
were wet eyes in the world, before you were born,
girls, and there will be wet eyes long after we are
all dead; and always for the same reason—because
somebody loves somebody.
</p>
<p>
“He is a hard worker—I rejoice in his life. Five
years ago he came home, but not to Dunellen; he
had no friends here; after resting awhile he returned
to his field of labor, and died before he
reached it, but was buried in the place he loved
better than home.
</p>
<p>
“I thought of him and loved him and prayed
for him through those twenty years. I think of
him and love him and give thanks for him now,
and shall till I die and afterwards!”
</p>
<p>
“Why didn’t you go with him?” asked Sue.
</p>
<p>
“He did not ask me.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264'></a>264</span>
</p>
<p>
“Would you if he had?”
</p>
<p>
“I certainly should.”
</p>
<p>
“Couldn’t you bring him to the point? It would
have been easy enough.”
</p>
<p>
“The gentleman did the asking in those days,”
Sue laughed. “And wasn’t he ever married?”
</p>
<p>
“No.”
</p>
<p>
“What a pity! I thought that every thing always
went right for people like you and Tessa.
But I don’t see where the perfect gift comes in, do
you, Tessa?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, but I’m afraid that I don’t want such a
perfect gift. I couldn’t bear it—twenty years.”
</p>
<p>
“Tell me—I can’t guess. Did he give you something?”
</p>
<p>
“No, <em>he</em> did not.”
</p>
<p>
“Didn’t he love <em>you?</em>”
</p>
<p>
“No, he did not love me.”
</p>
<p>
“Where is the gift then?”
</p>
<p>
“My love for him was my perfect gift. It was
given by One in whom there is no shadow of
turning.”
</p>
<p>
“I am not strong enough to receive such a gift,”
said Tessa looking troubled.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me, I hope not. Oh, dear me, horrid!
What a story to tell the night before my wedding!
All I care about is about <em>being loved!</em> I didn’t
know that the loving made any difference or did
any good! That story is too sorrowful. Gerald
would like that.”
</p>
<p>
The long ivory needle moved in and out; the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265'></a>265</span>
fair face, half a century old, was full of loveliness.
</p>
<p>
“That is for you to remember all your life, Sue.”
</p>
<p>
“I sha’n’t. I shall forget it. I only remember
pleasant things.”
</p>
<p>
“I wonder if Fredrika Bremer were as happy as
you, Miss Jewett. She says that a gentleman inspired
her with a ‘pure and warm feeling,’ that it
was never responded to, and yet it had a powerful
influence upon her development.”
</p>
<p>
“Was she <em>real?</em>” inquired Sue. “I thought that
she only wrote books.”
</p>
<p>
“It takes very real people to write,” answered
Tessa. “The more real you are, the more you are
called to write.”
</p>
<p>
Slipping off the low chair, down to the rug, Sue
laid her head in Miss Jewett’s lap, the white wool
half concealing the braids and curls and frizzes,
the thin, excited face was turned toward the fire,
the brown eyes, wild and yet timid, were misty
with tears.
</p>
<p>
Miss Jewett and Tessa Wadsworth were the only
people in the world who had ever seen this phase
of Sue Greyson.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Lake had never seen her subdued or frightened.
At this instant she was both. There were
some things that Sue could feel; there were not any
that she could understand.
</p>
<p>
“Sometimes,” said Sue, in a hollow whisper, “I’m
so afraid, I want to run away; I was afraid I might
run away and so I asked Tessa to come to-night.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266'></a>266</span>
</p>
<p>
“My dear!” Miss Jewett’s warm lips touched
her forehead.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, it isn’t any thing! I like Gerald; I adore
him. I wouldn’t marry him if I didn’t! I am
always afraid of a leap into the dark, and I am
always jumping into dark places.”
</p>
<p>
“It is a leap for <em>him</em>, too, Sue; you seem to forget
that,” suggested Tessa.
</p>
<p>
“You always think of him, you never think of
me.”
</p>
<p>
“It is a pity for no one to think of him; if I
were to be married to-morrow, I should cry all
night, out of pity for the hapless bridegroom.”
</p>
<p>
“Tessa, you ridiculous child,” exclaimed Miss
Jewett.
</p>
<p>
“In books,” Sue went on, still with her face
turned from them, “girls choose the one they are
to marry out of all the world. Why don’t we?”
</p>
<p>
“We do,” said Tessa.
</p>
<p>
“We don’t. We take somebody because he asks
us and nobody else asks.”
</p>
<p>
“<em>I</em> will not. I do not believe that God means it
so. He chooses that we shall satisfy the best and
hungriest part of ourselves, and the best part is the
hungriest, and the hungriest the best; we may not
have opportunity in one year, or two years, or ten
years, but if we wait He will give us the things
we most need! He did not give us any longing
simply to make us go crying through the universe;
the longing is His message making known to us
that the good thing <em>is</em>. I will not be false
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267'></a>267</span>
to myself, cheating myself by shutting my eyes and saying,
‘Ah, <em>this</em> is good! I have found my choice,’
when my whole soul protests, knowing that it is
a lie. I can wait.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Tessa!” laughed Sue. “Doesn’t she talk
like a book? I never half know what she means
when she goes into such hysterics. Do you expect
to get all your good things?”
</p>
<p>
“All <em>my</em> good things! Yes, every single one; it
is only a question of time. God can not forget,
nor can He die. I shall not be discouraged until
I am sure that He is dead.”
</p>
<p>
“O, Tessa, you are wicked,” cried Sue.
</p>
<p>
“You remind me of something,” said Miss Jewett.
“‘Blessed are all they that wait <em>for Him</em>.’”
</p>
<p>
“I can’t wait for my blessings,” said Sue; “I
want to snatch them.”
</p>
<p>
Gently pushing aside Sue’s head, Tessa found her
work and her needle; she worked silently while
Sue laughed and grumbled and Miss Jewett talked,
not over Sue’s head as Tessa’s habit was, but into
her heart.
</p>
<p>
“Sue, I shall lose you in Bible class.”
</p>
<p>
“I never answered any questions or studied any
lesson, you will not care for my empty place. Gerald
is getting awfully good; he reads the Bible and
Prayer-book every night; every morning when I
go in to fix up his room, I find them on a little
table by his bed; I suppose he reads in bed nights.
He used to be bad and talk dreadful things when
he first came; did you ever hear him, Tessa?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268'></a>268</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“But he’s awful good now; he thinks that people
ought to go to church, and say their prayers; I hope
he will keep it up; <em>I</em> will not hinder him. I want
to be good, too.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa’s needle moved in and out; she did not
hear Sue’s voice, or see the kneeling, green figure;
her eyes were looking upon the face she had looked
down into that evening in January, such a little
time since; and she was hearing her voice as she
heard it in the night. Had she forgotten so soon?
Or was it the remembrance that gave her the unrest
to-night? Was she conscious without understanding?
And had <em>her</em> Ralph Towne done this?
After having withdrawn himself from Sue, was he
keeping her from seeing the good and the happiness
of marriage with Dr. Lake? Would the
thought of him come between her and the contentment
that she might have had?
</p>
<p>
But no, she was putting herself into Sue’s position;
that would not do; it was Sue’s self and not
her own self that she must analyze! If she could
tell Ralph Towne her fears to-night, his eyes would
grow dark and grave, and then he would toss the
feeling away with his amused laugh and say, “Sue
is not deep enough for that! She did not care for
me. Why must you think a romance about her?”
</p>
<p>
Was she not deep enough for that? Who could
tell that?
</p>
<p>
She listened to Sue’s lively talk and tried to believe
that his reply would be just; the one most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269'></a>269</span>
bitter thought of all was, that if she were suffering
it was through his selfishness or stupidity. Why
must he be so stupid about such things? Had he
no heart himself?
</p>
<p>
Sue was laughing again. “Oh, dear! I must be
happy; if I am not I shall be unhappy! It would
kill me to be unhappy! I never think of unpleasant
things five minutes.”
</p>
<p>
The sound of wheels near the windows, and a
call to “Jerry” in a loud, quick voice, brought them
all to a startling sense of the present.
</p>
<p>
“There he is,” cried Sue, springing lightly to her
feet.
</p>
<p>
Tessa was relieved that she said “he” instead of
“Gerald” or “Dr. Lake.”
</p>
<p>
“If you will not stay all night, too, Miss Jewett,
he shall take you home.”
</p>
<p>
“I can not, dear. I only came because I wanted
to talk with Sue Greyson once more before I lost
her.”
</p>
<p>
Rubbers and waterproof were hurried on, and
Tessa was left alone with the fire, the rain, and
her work.
</p>
<p>
Suppose that it were herself who was to be married
to-morrow—
</p>
<p>
Would she wish to run away? Run away from
whom? Although her Ralph Towne had died and
been buried, that old, sharp, sweet, memory was
wrapped around her still; it would always be sweet
although so sharp—and bitterly, bitterly sharp although
so sweet; if it might become wholly the one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270'></a>270</span>
or wholly the other, but it could never be that; never
unless she learned Love’s lesson as Mrs. Towne
had laid it before her. But that was so utterly and
hopelessly beyond her present growth!
</p>
<p>
Would he despise her if he could know how much
that happy time was in her thoughts? Was she
tenacious where stronger minds would forget? He
would think her weak and romantic like the heroine
of a story paper novel; that is, if he could think
weak any thing so wholly innocent.
</p>
<p>
She trusted the emerald ring on her finger; at
times it burned into her flesh; sometimes she tore
it off that she might forget her promise, and then—oh,
foolish, incomprehensible, womanly Tessa!—she
would take it again and slip it on with a reverence
and love for the old memory that she could not be
ashamed of although she tried.
</p>
<p>
Had she been too hard upon Ralph Towne in
their latest interview? Why need she have given
shape to her hitherto unspoken thoughts concerning
his life; she could not tell him of her prayers
that he might change and yet become—for it was
not too late—the good, good man that she had
once believed him to be. He had taken away her
faith in himself; he might give it back, grown
stronger, if he would. If he only would!
</p>
<p>
Dr. Greyson’s step was in the hall; Sue’s voice
was less excited, her father was speaking quietly to
her. Sue, poor Sue! She would never be again
the free, wild Sue Greyson that she was to-night.
</p>
<p>
Tessa felt Dr. Lake’s mood; she could have written
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271'></a>271</span>
out his thoughts, as he drove homeward in the
rain; she dreaded his hilarious entrance, how his
eyes would shine, with tears close behind them!
</p>
<p>
Her reverie was interrupted by the entrance that
she dreaded. “Ah, Mystic, praying for my happiness
here alone! I know you are. I come to be
congratulated.”
</p>
<p>
“I congratulate you,” she said rising and taking
his hand. Not so very long afterward, when she saw
his cold, dead hands folded together and touched
them, she remembered with starting tears this soft,
hot, clinging clasp.
</p>
<p>
“You didn’t dream of this two months ago, did
you?” he cried, dropping into the chair that Sue
had been sitting in. “You didn’t know that I was
born under a lucky star despite all my woeful past.
I have turned over a new leaf; I turned it over to-night
in the rain; it is chapter first. Such a white
page, Mystic. Don’t you want to write something
on it for me?”
</p>
<p>
“I wouldn’t dare.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes, you would! What do you wish for
me? Write that.”
</p>
<p>
“I wish for you—” she rolled the white wool over
her hand.
</p>
<p>
“Well, go on! Something that must come true!”
</p>
<p>
“—The love that suffers long and is <em>kind</em>.”
</p>
<p>
“Whew!” He drew a long breath. “There is
no place for that in me.”
</p>
<p>
Sue entered noisily. She did every thing noisily.
</p>
<p>
“Come here, Susan.” Dr. Lake caught her in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272'></a>272</span>
his arms, but she slipped through them, moving to
Tessa’s side, seating herself upon the rug, and resting
both hands in Tessa’s lap.
</p>
<p>
“I was reading the other day”—he stooped to
smooth Sue’s flounce—“of a fellow who fell dead
upon his wedding day, as soon as the knot was
tied. Perhaps it was tied too tight and choked him.
Suppose I drop dead, Susan, will you like to be a
bewitching young widow so soon? Whom would
you find to flirt with before night?”
</p>
<p>
“Gerald, you are wicked!”
</p>
<p>
“Probably this bridegroom had heart disease. I
haven’t heart disease, except for you, my Shrine,
my Heart’s Desire.”
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t he wretched, Tessa? He tells me all kinds
of stories about people dying of joy!”
</p>
<p>
He bent forward, drawing her towards him backward,
and with both arms around her, kissed the
top of her head and her forehead.
</p>
<p>
“You mustn’t do so before folks,” said Sue shaking
herself free.
</p>
<p>
“Mystic isn’t folks! She is my guardian angel.”
</p>
<p>
“I know that you would rather have married
her.”
</p>
<p>
“But she wouldn’t rather have married me, would
you, Mystic?”
</p>
<p>
“I can’t imagine it,” returned Tessa, as seriously
as he had spoken. “Set your jealous heart at rest,
Sue.”
</p>
<p>
“I never thought of it, but once in my life,” he
continued, musingly, “and that was when I was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273'></a>273</span>
down in the deeps about you, Susan; I did think
that she might drag me out—a drowning man, you
know, will catch at a straw. It was one night
when she was weeding her pansies and refused to
ride with me. I’m glad that you never <em>did</em> refuse
me, Mystic, you couldn’t be setting there so
composedly.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes, I would; I should have known that
you were insane.”
</p>
<p>
“I was insane—all one week.”
</p>
<p>
“I believe that,” said Sue.
</p>
<p>
“I wonder what we shall all be thinking about
the next time that we three sit here together! It
will be too late for us to go back then, Susan; the
die will be cast, the Rubicon crossed, another poor
man undone forever. Are you regretting it, child?”
drawing her again towards him backward and gazing
down into her face. “Shall we quit at this last
last minute? Speak the word! You never shall
throw it up at me, that I urged you into it. It will
be a mess for us if we do hate each other after
awhile.”
</p>
<p>
“I will never hate you, Gerald.”
</p>
<p>
“But I might hate you, though, who knows?”
smoothing her hair with his graceful, weak hands.
</p>
<p>
“Then Tessa shall be peacemaker,” said Sue
straightening herself.
</p>
<p>
“No; I will not,” replied Tessa, gathering her
work and rising. “Sue, you will find me up-stairs.”
</p>
<p>
“Then I’m coming, too; I don’t want to stay and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274'></a>274</span>
be sentimental. Gerald will talk—I know him—and
I will cry, and how I would look to-morrow!
I want you to do a little fixing for me and to try
my hair low and then high.”
</p>
<p>
“I like it high,” said Dr. Lake.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t. I like it low. Tessa you shall try it
low, like Nan Gerard’s. Say, Gerald, shall I put
on my dress after she has fixed my hair and come
down and let you see it.”
</p>
<p>
“I think I have seen it. Didn’t you try it on
for me and tell me that that fellow liked it? I
hate that dress; if you dress to please me, you will
wear the one you have on now.”
</p>
<p>
“This old thing! I see myself. No, I shall wear
my wedding dress. It fits to perfection. I want
to look pretty once in my life.”
</p>
<p>
“You will never look prettier than you do this
minute! Come here,” opening his arms towards
her.
</p>
<p>
“No, I won’t. Let me alone, Dr. Lake.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa was already on the stairs; Sue ran towards
her laughing and screaming, the parlor door was
closed with a bang.
</p>
<p>
“Now he’s angry,” cried Sue, tripping on the
stairs. “I don’t care; he wants me to stay and
talk sentiment, and I <em>hate</em> being sentimental. And,
Tessa, you sha’n’t talk to me, either.”
</p>
<p>
“Where is your father?” inquired Tessa, standing
on the threshold of Sue’s chamber.
</p>
<p>
“In the dining-room drying his feet and drinking
a cup of coffee.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275'></a>275</span>
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you want to go down and say good night?
He will lose every thing when he loses you.”
</p>
<p>
Sue hesitated. “I don’t know how to be tender
and loving, I should make a fool of myself; he isn’t
over and above pleased with this thing anyway;
he never did pet me as your father has petted you.
Your father is like a mother. He said once when
I was a little girl that he wished that I had died
and Freddie had lived; Freddie was two years older
and as bright as a button. Father loved him. I
shall never forget that; I shall never forgive him no
matter how kind he is to me. And he swears at me
when he is angry with me; he used to, but Gerald
told him that he should not swear at <em>his</em> wife! Father
said that he didn’t mean any thing by it. Gerald
will be kinder to me than father has been; father
swears at me in one breath and calls me the comfort
of his old age in the next. You can’t turn him
into your father if you talk about him all night.”
</p>
<p>
“But he will be glad if you go down; he will
think of it some day and so will you.”
</p>
<p>
“He isn’t sentimental and I can’t be. Besides I
have some things to put into my trunk, and I want
to put a ruffle into my wrapper that I may have it
all ready. It’s eleven o’clock now; we shall not be
asleep to-night.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa urged no more; it was not her father who
was drying his feet and drinking his coffee down-stairs
alone on the night before her wedding day.
How he would look at her and take her into his
arms with tears.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276'></a>276</span>
</p>
<p>
Sue opened her trunk. “Gerald’s things are all
in. It does seem queer to have his things packed
up with mine. And when we come home every
thing will go on just the same only I shall be Mrs.
Lake instead of Miss Greyson.”
</p>
<p>
As Tessa stood behind her arranging her hair,
She said, “There, I like that. I almost look like
Nan Gerard. What do you think she said to-day?
She was here with Mary Sherwood to see father
and they saw Mr. Ralph in my album. ‘That’s
the man I intend to marry,’ she said, ‘eyes, money,
and all.’ Mary scolded her but she only laughed.
She said that if she couldn’t get him, she should
take the professor, for he was just as handsome
and could talk about something beside paregoric
and postmortem examinations.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa said nothing. How she had pitied Nan
Gerard, and how harshly she had misjudged Dr.
Towne. She was awakened in the night by Sue’s
voice—
</p>
<p>
“Put your arm around me, Tessa.”
</p>
<p>
The long night ended at last in the dull dawn,
for it was raining still. Tessa had slept fitfully;
Sue had lain perfectly quiet, not speaking again
or moving.
</p>
<p>
At eleven o’clock Sue and Dr. Lake were married.
Dr. Greyson sat with his head in his hands,
turned away from them, his broad frame shaking
from head to foot; Tessa did not look at Dr. Lake:
she sat on a sofa beside Mrs. Towne, with her eyes
fixed on the carpet. Sue cried and laughed together
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277'></a>277</span>
when her father kissed her; she drew herself
to the full height of Mrs. Gerald Lake, when
Dr. Towne shook hands with her. At half past
twelve the bride and bridegroom were driven to
the depot; Tessa remained to give a few orders
to the servants, and was then taken home in Dr.
Towne’s carriage.
</p>
<p>
“It seems to me as lonely as a funeral,” she said;
“and Sue is laughing and eating chocolate cream
drops this very minute. Marriage should be a leap
into the sunshine.”
</p>
<p>
“I hope that yours will be,” her companion said
in his gravest tone.
</p>
<p>
“If it ever <em>is</em>, you may rest assured that it will
be. It will be the very happiest sunshine that ever
shone out of heaven.”
</p>
<p>
She was learning to talk to Dr. Towne as easily
as she talked to her father, for he was the one man
in the world that she was sure that she would never
marry; she knew that he desired it as little as she
did herself.
</p>
<p>
“Why will it be so happy?”
</p>
<p>
“Because I shall wait till I am <em>satisfied</em>.”
</p>
<p>
“Satisfied with him? You will never be that.”
</p>
<p>
“Then I shall wither in single blessedness; I
shall be unhappily not married instead of unhappily
married.”
</p>
<p>
“Philip Towne is your ideal.”
</p>
<p>
“I know it,” she said. “I like to think that he
is in the world. He makes me as happy as a
pansy.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278'></a>278</span>
</p>
<p>
“Women are never happy with their ideals.”
</p>
<p>
“They seldom have an opportunity of testing
it; Professor Towne has a pure heart and he has
brains.”
</p>
<p>
Dr. Towne answered in words that she never
forgot, “That is what he says of you.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I am so glad! I like to have that said of
me better than any thing.”
</p>
<p>
She remembered, but she would not tell him,
that a lady had said of him, having seen him but
a few moments, and not having heard him speak,
that he was a “rock.”
</p>
<p>
“And I love rocks and know all about them,”
she had added.
</p>
<p>
“They give shadow in a weary land,” Tessa had
thought. “I have been in a weary land and he has
<em>not</em> been a shadow to me.”
</p>
<p>
After a silent moment he spoke, “Don’t you
think that you were rather hard on me last week?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” she said frankly, “I have thought it all
over; I intended to tell you that I was sorry; I <em>am</em>
sorry; I will not do so again.”
</p>
<p>
“Till next time?”
</p>
<p>
“There shall not be any next time; in my
thoughts I have been very unjust to you; I have
come nearer hating, really <em>hating</em> you, than any
other person I ever knew. I am sorry; I am always
sorry to be unjust.”
</p>
<p>
One look into the sunshiny eyes satisfied her
that she was forgiven. It almost seemed as if
they were on the old confidential footing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279'></a>279</span>
</p>
<p>
“Have you gathered any autumn leaves?” he
asked.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, some beautiful ones. I did not get any
last year—” She stopped, confused.
</p>
<p>
She had lived through her year without him.
Was he remembering last October, too?
</p>
<p>
About sunset it cleared; she was glad for Dr.
Lake’s sake; about the bride she did not think;
Sue would be thankful if none of her bridal finery
were spoiled.
</p>
<p>
The evening mail brought a letter from Dinah.
</p>
<p>
There were two pieces of news in it, in both of
which Tessa was interested. The school-master
was twenty-one years of age, “a lovable fellow,
the room grows dark when he goes out of it, and
he likes best the books that I do.” This came first,
she read on to find that Professor Towne’s mother
and sister had come this summer to the house over
the way, that Miss Towne was “perfectly lovely”
and had been an invalid for fifteen years, not having
put her foot to the ground in all that time; she
could move about on the first floor, but passed most
of her time in a chair, reading, writing, and doing
the most beautiful fancy work. She was beautiful,
like Professor Towne, but the mother was only a
fussy old lady. Her name was Sarepta!
</p>
<p>
Dinah’s letters were rather apt to be ecstatic and
incoherent. Tessa wrote five pages in her book
that night and a foolscap sheet to Dinah.
</p>
<p>
She fell asleep thinking of what Professor Towne
had said about her.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280'></a>280</span><a name='ch18' id='ch18'></a>XVIII.—MOODS.</h2>
<p>
All through the month of October she felt cross,
sometimes she looked cross, but she did not speak
one cross word, not even once; she was not what
we call “sweet” in her happiest moods, but she
was thoroughly sound in her temper and often a
little, just a very little, sharp. Never sharp to
her father, however, because she reverenced him,
and never to her mother because she was pitiful
towards her; she could appreciate so few of life’s
best havings and givings, that Tessa could never
make her enjoyment less by speaking the thoughts
that, at times, almost forced their own utterance;
therefore her mood was kept to herself all through
the month.
</p>
<p>
There was no month in the year that she loved
as well as she loved October; in any of its days it
was a trial to be kept within doors.
</p>
<p>
She would have phrased her mood as “cross”
if she had had the leisure or the inclination to
keep a diary; she had kept a journal during the
first year of her friendship with Ralph Towne and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281'></a>281</span>
had burned it before the year was ended in one of
her times of being ashamed of herself.
</p>
<p>
One of the happenings that irritated her was the
finding in her desk a scrap of a rhyme that she
had written one summer day after a talk with
Ralph Towne; she dropped it into the parlor grate
chiding herself for ever having been so nonsensical
and congratulating herself upon having outgrown
it.
</p>
<p>
It was called <em>The Silent Side</em> and was the story
of a maiden wandering in the twilight up a lane
bordered with daisies, somebody didn’t come and
her eyes grew tired of watching and her heart
beat faint with waiting, so she wandered down
the daisy-bordered lane! She did feel a little tender
over the last lines even if she were laughing
over it:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Father,’&nbsp;&nbsp;she&nbsp;&nbsp;said,&nbsp;&nbsp;‘I&nbsp;&nbsp;may&nbsp;&nbsp;not&nbsp;&nbsp;say,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But&nbsp;&nbsp;will&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;not&nbsp;&nbsp;tell&nbsp;&nbsp;him&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;love&nbsp;&nbsp;him&nbsp;&nbsp;so?”<br />
</p>
<p>
Had any one in all the world of maidenhood beside
her ever prayed such a prayer? Old words
came to her: “Thou knowest my foolishness.”
</p>
<p>
The rhyme was dated the afternoon that Ralph
Towne had said—but what right had she to remember
anything that he had said? He had
forgotten and despised her for remembering; but
he could not despise her as much as she despised
herself!
</p>
<p>
Why was it that understanding him as she certainly
did understand him, that she knew that she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282'></a>282</span>
would fly to the ends of the earth with him if he
should take her hand and say, “Come”; that is,
she was <em>afraid</em> that she would. It was no marvel
that the knowledge gave her a feeling of discomfort,
of intense dissatisfaction with herself; how woefully
wrong she must be for such a thing to be true!
</p>
<p>
On the blank side of a sheet of manuscript, she
scribbled a stanza that haunted her; it gave expression
to the life she had lived during the two
years just passed.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“A&nbsp;&nbsp;nightingale&nbsp;&nbsp;made&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;mistake;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She&nbsp;&nbsp;sang&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;few&nbsp;&nbsp;notes&nbsp;&nbsp;out&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;tune;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her&nbsp;&nbsp;heart&nbsp;&nbsp;was&nbsp;&nbsp;ready&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;break,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And&nbsp;&nbsp;she&nbsp;&nbsp;hid&nbsp;&nbsp;from&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;moon.”<br />
</p>
<p>
In this month her book was accepted; that check
for two hundred and six dollars gave pleasure that
she and others remembered all their lives; with this
check came one for fifteen dollars for Dinah; she almost
laughed her crossness away over Dine’s little
check.
</p>
<p>
Dine’s reply was characteristic:
</p>
<p>
“Thus endeth my first and last venture upon the
literary sea; I follow in your wake no longer.
</p>
<p>
“If it were matrimony now—
</p>
<p>
“John (isn’t John a grand, strong name?) doesn’t
like literary women. He reads Owen Meredith to
me, and Miss Mulock. He says that I am like Miss
Mulock’s <em>Edna</em>.”
</p>
<p>
Each letter of Dine’s teemed with praises of John
Woodstock; she thought that he was like Adam
Bede, or Ninian in “Head of the Family,” or perhaps
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283'></a>283</span>
Max in “A Life for a Life”; she was lonely
all day long without him, and as happy as she
could be on earth with him all the long evenings.
</p>
<p>
Tessa frowned over the letters; Dine made no
allusion to him in letters written to her father and
mother; her whole loving, girlish heart she poured
out to Tessa. And Tessa cried over them and
prayed over them.
</p>
<p>
Sue returned from her bridal tour undeniably
miserable; even the radiant mood of Dr. Lake was
much subdued. Tessa met them together at Mrs.
Towne’s one evening, two days after the coming
home, and was cut to the heart by their manner
towards each other: she was defiant; he, imploring.
</p>
<p>
“I’m sorry I’m married any way,” she exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t say that,” he remonstrated, his face flushing
painfully.
</p>
<p>
“I will say it—I <em>do</em> say it! I <em>am</em> sorry!”
</p>
<p>
“You know that you don’t mean it.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I do mean it, too.”
</p>
<p>
Dr. Towne glanced at Tessa and gave an embarrassed
laugh. Mrs. Towne’s expression became
severe; Tessa could have shaken Sue. Nan Gerard
turned on the music stool with her most perfect
laugh; Tessa could have shaken <em>her</em> for the enlightenment
that ran through it.
</p>
<p>
“We will have no more music after that,” said
Professor Towne.
</p>
<p>
Sue bade Tessa good night holding both her
hands. “I wish I had married Stacey,” she whispered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284'></a>284</span>
</p>
<p>
“Don’t tell Dr. Lake, I beg of you.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, he knows it. Come and see me.”
</p>
<p>
“No, I will not. You shall not talk to me about
your husband.”
</p>
<p>
“I will if I want to. You must come.”
</p>
<p>
“Do come,” urged Dr. Lake coming towards
them. But she would not promise.
</p>
<p>
The last Saturday evening in October found Tessa
alone before the fire in Mrs. Towne’s sitting-room;
Mrs. Towne was not well, and had sent for her to
come; she had gone to her sleeping room immediately
after tea, and asked Tessa to come to her in
two hours.
</p>
<p>
She was in a “mood”; so she called it to herself,
a mood in which self-analysis held the prominent
place; her heart was aching, she knew not for
what, she hardly cared, if the aching might be
taken away and she could go to sleep and then
awake to find the sun shining.
</p>
<p>
For the last hour she had been curled up in a
crimson velvet chair, part of the time with her
head bowed upon the arm; there were tears on her
eyelashes, on her fingers, and on the crimson velvet.
In the low light, she was but a gray figure crowned
with chestnut braids, and only that Ralph Towne
saw when he entered noiselessly through the half
open door.
</p>
<p>
Tessa thought that no one in the world moved
so gently or touched her so lightly as Ralph Towne.
He stood an instant beside her before she stirred,
then she raised her head slowly, ashamed of her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285'></a>285</span>
flushed, wet cheeks. She could not hide from the
moon.
</p>
<p>
“Well?” she said, thinking of her eyes and
cheeks.
</p>
<p>
“Are you dreaming dreams alone, here in the
dark?”
</p>
<p>
“I’m afraid so; I dream too many dreams; I
want something real; I do not like the stuff that
dreams are made of.”
</p>
<p>
“You are real enough.” He leaned against the
low mantel with one elbow resting upon it; she
did not lift her eyes; she was afraid. Had he
come to say something to her?
</p>
<p>
“Miss Tessa.”
</p>
<p>
She did not reply, she was rubbing her fingers
over the crimson velvet.
</p>
<p>
“I have been thinking of something that I wish
to say to you.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I am approachable,” in a light, saucy
voice.
</p>
<p>
“Think well before you speak; it is a question
that, middle-aged as I am, I never asked any woman
before; I want to ask you to become my wife.”
</p>
<p>
She had raised her eyes in surprise, unfeigned
surprise.
</p>
<p>
“You need not look like that,” he said irritably;
“you look as if you had never thought of it.”
</p>
<p>
“I have not—for a long time; perhaps I did
once—before I became old and wise. I <em>am</em> surprised,
I can not understand it; I was so sure that
you could never care for me.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286'></a>286</span>
</p>
<p>
“Why should I not? It is the most natural thing
in the world.”
</p>
<p>
“I do not think so; I can not understand.”
</p>
<p>
“Accept it upon my testimony, do not try to understand
it.”
</p>
<p>
He betrayed no feeling, except in his quickened
tone; she was too bewildered to be conscious of any
feeling at all; she listened to the sound of her own
voice, as if another were speaking; she remembered
afterward, that for once in her life she had heard
the sound of her own voice. She was thinking,
“My voice <em>is</em> pleasant, only so cold and even.”
</p>
<p>
“Will you not answer me?”
</p>
<p>
She was thinking; she had forgotten to answer.
</p>
<p>
“Why should you like me?” she said at last.
</p>
<p>
“There’s reason enough, allow me to judge; but
you do not come to the point.”
</p>
<p>
“I do not know how.”
</p>
<p>
“I thought that coming to the point was one of
your excellences.”
</p>
<p>
“Your question—your assertion rather—is something
very new.”
</p>
<p>
She could see the words; she was reciting them
from a printed page.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you know whether you like me or not?”
he asked in the old assured, boyish way.
</p>
<p>
“No, I do not know that; if I did I should care
for what you are saying, and now I do not care.
Once, in that time when I loved you and you did
not care, I would have died with joy to hear you
say what you have said; my heart would have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287'></a>287</span>
stopped beating; I should have been too glad to
live; but perhaps when <em>that</em> you went away and
died, the Tessa that loved you went away and
died, too. I think that I <em>did</em> die—of shame. Now
I hear you speak the words that I used to pray
then every night that you might speak to me, and
now I do not care! When I was little I cried myself
sick once for something I wanted, and when
mother gave it to me I was too sick and tired to
care. No, I do not want to marry you, Dr. Towne,
I am too sick and tired to love you.”
</p>
<p>
“Why do you not want to marry me?”
</p>
<p>
“Because—because—” she looked up into his
grave eyes—“I do not want to; I am not satisfied
with you.”
</p>
<p>
“Why are you not satisfied with me?”
</p>
<p>
“I do not know.”
</p>
<p>
“Are you disappointed in me? Have I changed?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no,” she said sorrowfully, “you have not
changed—not since I have known you this time.
It is like this, as if I were blind when I knew you
before, and I loved you for what you were to me;
but as I could not see you, I loved you for what I
imagined you to be, and now, I am not blind, my
eyes are wide, wide open, and I look at you and
wonder ‘where is the one I knew?’ I do not
know you; you are a stranger to me; I would love
you if I could; I can not say <em>yes</em> and not love you.
I have never told any one, but I may tell you now.
While you were away at St. Louis, I promised to
marry some one; he had loved me all my life, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288'></a>288</span>
I was so heart-broken because of the mistake that I
had made about you; and I wanted some one to
care for me, so that I might forget how I loved
somebody that did not love me. And then I was
wild when I knew what I had done! I did not
love him; I felt as if I were bound in iron; I shall
never forget that. I do not want to feel bound in
iron to you. Why did you not ask me last year
when you knew how I cared for you?”
</p>
<p>
He dropped his eyes, the hot color flushing even
to his forehead. “I could not—sincerely.”
</p>
<p>
“Why did you act as if you liked me?”
</p>
<p>
“I did like you. I did not love you. I did not
understand. I can not tell you how unhappy I
was when I found that you had misunderstood me.
I would not have hurt you for all the universe; I
did not dream that you could misunderstand me; I
was attracted to you; I did not know that I manifested
any stronger feeling. Surely you have forgiven
me.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I have forgiven you; I did not really
blame you; I knew that you did not understand.
You are a stupid fellow about women.—You are
only a stupid, dear, big boy.”
</p>
<p>
“But you do not answer me.”
</p>
<p>
“I <em>have</em> answered you. Do you ask me sincerely
now?” she asked curiously.
</p>
<p>
“You know I do,” he said angrily.
</p>
<p>
“Do you ask me because Miss Gerard has refused
you?” with a flash of merriment crossing
her face.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289'></a>289</span>
</p>
<p>
“I never asked Miss Gerard.”
</p>
<p>
“Did you flirt with her?”
</p>
<p>
“I suppose you give it that name. I was attracted
towards her, of course, but I soon found
that she had no depth; she would cling to me, I
could not shake her off. I took her to Mayfield
this morning; she asked to go, I could not refuse
the girl. She has made several pretty things for
me; I showed my appreciation by buying pieces
of jewelry for her; was that flirting? I never
kissed her, or said I loved her, or talked any nonsense
to her.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course not. You do not know how.”
</p>
<p>
“I know how to talk sense, Miss Tessa.”
</p>
<p>
“Are you asking me because your mother loves
me so much?”
</p>
<p>
“Is it so hard for you to believe that I love you?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” she said, her eyes filling at his tone, “I
can not believe it. It is as if you had put both
hands around my throat and choked my breath
away and then said politely, ‘Excuse me.’”
</p>
<p>
“Is my love so little to you as that?”
</p>
<p>
“I have not seen it yet; you <em>say</em> you love me,
that is all.”
</p>
<p>
“Is not that enough?”
</p>
<p>
“It can not be enough, for it does not satisfy
me. I have believed so long that you despised
me; one word from you can not change it all.”
</p>
<p>
“Is there something wrong about me?”
</p>
<p>
“Wrong? Oh, no. How could there be? I do
believe that you are a <em>good</em> man.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290'></a>290</span>
</p>
<p>
“You think that you can not be happy with
me?” he asked patiently.
</p>
<p>
“I am happy enough always, everywhere; I was
as happy as a bird in a tree before I knew you; you
set me to crying for something, and then held out
your hand empty.”
</p>
<p>
“I love you; isn’t that full enough?”
</p>
<p>
“No, that is not full enough. I want you to <em>be</em>
all that I believed you to be. I shall not be satisfied
till then. When you think of me you may
think of me hungering and thirsting for you to be
all that I can dream of your being—all that God is
willing to make you.”
</p>
<p>
The light had died out of his eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Do you know some one that does satisfy you?”
</p>
<p>
“I know good people, but they do not satisfy
me.”
</p>
<p>
“Philip Towne?”
</p>
<p>
“I should as soon think of loving St. John.”
</p>
<p>
“Tell me, <em>do</em> you love him?”
</p>
<p>
“Dr. Towne, I never thought of such a thing!”
she said with quick indignation.
</p>
<p>
“You are a Mystic; Dr. Lake has named you
true. Come, be sensible and don’t talk riddles;
don’t talk like a book; talk plain, good sense; say
<em>yes</em>, and leave all your whims behind you forever.”
</p>
<p>
“Loving you was a whim; shall I leave that
behind forever?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“Then I could not endure your presence; it is
that that keeps you near me now. It is not enough
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291'></a>291</span>
for you to love me; I should die of hunger if I did
not love you.”
</p>
<p>
“Love me, then.”
</p>
<p>
Her head went down upon the arm of the chair;
she covered her face with both hands; a childish
attitude she often assumed when alone.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t, I can’t! I want to; I would if I could!
it’s too late; I can’t go back and see you as you
were—”
</p>
<p>
“I have asked you to forgive me.”
</p>
<p>
“I do, I do; but I do not love you as I want to
love you. I shall never marry any one, you may
be sure of that; I do not want to be married. Why
must I? Who says I must?”
</p>
<p>
“I say so.”
</p>
<p>
“Your authority I do not recognize. The voice
must come from God to my own heart.”
</p>
<p>
“Lift your head. Look at me.”
</p>
<p>
She obeyed.
</p>
<p>
“I wish you to understand that I am not to be
trifled with; this is definite; this is final; I have
asked and you have refused. You need not play
with me thinking that I shall ask you again, <em>I
never shall</em>. Remember, I never shall.”
</p>
<p>
“I do not wish you to ask me again.”
</p>
<p>
“Then this ends the matter.”
</p>
<p>
“This ends the matter,” she repeated.
</p>
<p>
“My mother is not well, she will miss you; you
will stay with her just the same. She will not surmise
any thing. She loves you as I did not know
that one woman could love another.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292'></a>292</span>
</p>
<p>
“Is that why you wish to marry me?”
</p>
<p>
“No. I know my own mind. I have loved you
ever since I knew you, but I was not aware of it;
I did not know it until I knew that Miss Gerard
was not like you.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I am so sorry! This is the hardest of all.
But I might grow not to like you at all; I might
rush away from you; it takes so much love and
confidence and sympathy to be willing to give
one’s self.”
</p>
<p>
“I am not in a frame of mind to listen to such
things; you forget that you have thrown me away
for the sake of a whim!”
</p>
<p>
“I want to tell your mother; I can not bear for
her to be so kind to me—”
</p>
<p>
“It isn’t enough to hurt me, but you must hurt
her, also. She would not understand—any more
than I do—why you throw me away.”
</p>
<p>
“I will not tell her, but I shall feel like a hypocrite.
You will not utterly despise me.”
</p>
<p>
“You can not expect me to feel very kindly
towards you. Why may I not lose all but the
memory of <em>you</em>?”
</p>
<p>
“You may. I am willing,” she answered wearily.
“Oh, I <em>wanted</em> to be satisfied with you.”
</p>
<p>
He had left the room with his last words, not
waiting for reply.
</p>
<p>
And she could only cry out, with a dry, hard
sob, “Oh, Ralph, Ralph, I <em>wanted</em> to be satisfied
with you!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293'></a>293</span><a name='ch19' id='ch19'></a>XIX.—THE OLD STORY.</h2>
<p>
One afternoon in the reading-room she found two
notices of her book; one was in <em>Hearth and Home</em>,
the other in <em>The Lutheran Observer</em>; the former ran
in this style:
</p>
<p>
“‘Under the Wings’ by Theresa Louise Wadsworth
is the most lifelike representation of a genuine
live boy that we have seen for many a day.
We are almost tempted to think that the author
was once a boy herself she is so heartily in sympathy
with a boy’s thoughts and feelings. It is a
book that every boy ought to read, and we are confident
that no boy can read it without being bettered
by it.”
</p>
<p>
The other she was more pleased with:
</p>
<p>
“Rob is a genuine boy, with all manner of faults
and pranks; but a tender, truthful heart, and a determination
for the right that brings him through
safely. But specially is he delightful in juxtaposition
with Nell, a little girl who says the quaintest
things in the most laughable, most lovable manner.
Altogether it is a thoroughly enjoyable book, sweet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294'></a>294</span>
and saintly, too; though not saintly after the cut
and dried style of youthful piety.”
</p>
<p>
She turned the papers with a startled face as if
the lady in the black cloak near her had guessed
what she had looked for and had found; as if the
blonde mustache hidden behind Emerson surmised
that she had written a book and wondered why
she had not attempted something deeper; as if
Mr. Lewis Gesner reading a newspaper with his
forehead puckered into a frown knew that she
was slightly a blue-stocking, and decided that
she might better be learning how to be a good
wife for somebody.
</p>
<p>
“I <em>am</em> commonplace,” she soliloquized, running
down the long flight of stairs; “ten years ago when
my heroines were Rosalie and Viola, and their lovers
bandits or princes in disguise, who would have believed
that I could have settled down into writing
good books for good little children?”
</p>
<p>
That evening Mr. Hammerton took from his
memorandum book three square inches of printed
matter, neatly and exactly folded, and dropped it
into her hand.
</p>
<p>
“There’s a feather in your cap, Lady Blue; it is
plucked from the <em>Evening Mail</em>.”
</p>
<p>
She read it, by the light of the shaded lamp,
standing at the sitting-room table. Mrs. Wadsworth
looked up from her work, regarding her curiously;
Tessa did not observe the expression of pride
and love that flitted across her face. Mrs. Wadsworth
loved Tessa more than she loved any other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295'></a>295</span>
human being; indeed, with all her capacity for loving;
but Tessa would never discover it. Mrs. Wadsworth
was not aware of it, herself; Mr. Wadsworth
saw it and was glad. Tessa read eagerly:
</p>
<p>
“‘Under the Wings’ is the title of an excellent
book by Theresa Louise Wadsworth issued in neat
form by——. The characters of the boyish hero—wilful,
merry, irreverent, honest, and bold, and the
heroine—happy, serious, inquiring, and lovable, are
drawn with no mean skill, while the other personages,
the kind and pious grandmother, the snappish,
but well-meaning mother, the deacon, and others,
are sketched with scarcely less truth and vividness.
The development of the Christian faith in the soul
of wild Rob is traced easily and naturally, the incidents
are numerous and interesting; the whole
movement of the story is in helpful sympathy with
human hearts.”
</p>
<p>
“What is it, daughter?” inquired her father arranging
the chess-men.
</p>
<p>
“She is modest as well as famous. I will read
it,” said Mr. Hammerton, “and here’s your letter
from Dine; I knew that that would insure my welcome.
Do you know, I forgot to inquire for myself?
I never did such a thing before. Father will
go to the mail, however.”
</p>
<p>
Moving apart from the group, she ran through
the long letter; coloring and biting her lips as she
read. Mrs. Wadsworth’s little rocker was drawn to
the table; the light from the tall lamp fell over her
face and hair, touching her hands and her work;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296'></a>296</span>
the low, white forehead, the wavy hair, the pretty
lips and chin were pleasant to look upon; when
she was in a happy state of mind, this little lady
was altogether kissable.
</p>
<p>
“What does Dine say?” she asked.
</p>
<p>
“Not much. No news,” stammered Tessa.
</p>
<p>
“Hurry then and let me read it.”
</p>
<p>
“Excuse me, it is purely confidential, every vestige
to be consigned to the flames. You are to
have a letter in a day or two.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Hammerton gave her a quick glance and
moved his queen into check. She took the letter
into the parlor for a second perusal.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Tessa, my dear, big, wise sister, I’ve got
something to tell you. What should I do if I
hadn’t somebody to tell? At first I thought I
wouldn’t tell you or any body, and then I knew
I must. Norah knows, but she will never tell.
She does not know about Gus. I have never told
that, but she knows about my wonderful John! I
don’t know how to begin either; I guess I will begin
in the middle; all the blanks your own imagination
must fill. You know all about John; I’ve
told you enough if your head isn’t too full of literary
stuff to hold common affairs; <em>I’m in love</em> and
he is, too, of course. I should not be if he were
not. I mean I should not tell of it if he were not.
I’m glad that you are not the kind of elder sister
that can’t be told such things, for I could not tell
mother, and I would not dare tell dear, old father.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297'></a>297</span>
Not that it is so dreadful to be in love, even
if I have known him but seven weeks to-night; I
fell in love with him the instant he raised his eyes
and took hold of my hand. Living under the same
roof and eating together three times a day (he eats
so nicely), and ciphering and studying and reading
together, and going to church and prayer-meeting
and singing-school together, make the time seem
ten times as long and give twenty times as many
opportunities of falling in love decorously as I
could have found in Dunellen in a year! But I
am not apologizing for <em>that</em>. It’s too delightfully
delicious to have a <em>real</em> lover! Not that he has
asked me <em>yet</em>! I wouldn’t have him do it for any
thing; it would spoil it all. But we both knew it
as Adam and Eve knew it! Now the dreadfulness
of it is that I have no right to do such a thing. I
came here believing that I was lawfully and forever
engaged to dear old Gus, spectacles, chess-board,
dictionary and all. Not that <em>he</em> ever said
a word to <em>me</em>! Don’t you know one night I told
you that I had a secret? How glad I was of it
then! I couldn’t sleep that night and for days I
felt dizzy; for Gus had been my hero ever since he
told me stories when I was a wee child. And so
of course I thought I <em>loved</em> him. What is love,
anyway? Who knows? That secret was this: I
heard dear, old, wise Gus tell father that he loved
<em>me</em> (just think, <em>me!</em>) and that he was waiting for
me to love him, dear, old boy! He would not try
to make me love him, he wanted it to come naturally;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298'></a>298</span>
he would not speak to me or urge me, he
wanted to find me loving him and then he would
ask me to give him what belonged to him. Wasn’t
it touching? I didn’t know that he could be so
lover-like. I didn’t know that he ever would love
anybody because he always talks books and politics
and only made fun when I told him news about the
girls. How could I help loving him when I knew
that he loved me. Isn’t that enough to make anybody
love anybody?
</p>
<p>
“Just as soon as I saw my wonderful John, then
I knew that I did not love Gus, that I never had
loved him, that I never <em>could</em> love him. No, not to
the end of time. If I had married him, I suppose
that I should have been satisfied and thought I
was as happy as I could be—I don’t know, though.
He was wise to let me wait and have a choice: it
is cruel to ask girls before they have seen some one
else; we do not know what we do want until we
see it—or him. I am writing at the sitting-room
table; John has not come home from the mail;
Aunt Tessa knits a long, blue stocking and Uncle
Knox is asleep with the big white and black cat on
his knees.
</p>
<p>
“I never could stay here but for John and Miss
Towne. I have told <em>her</em> about John; she likes
John. Every one does.
</p>
<p>
“I want you to see my knight; he is not tall, he
is broad-shouldered, with the loveliest complexion
and blonde mustache, blue eyes, shining blue eyes,
and auburn curly hair! that is, <em>rather</em> auburn; I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299'></a>299</span>
think it is more like reddish gold. I wish that
you could hear him talk about making life a glorious
success. He makes me feel brave and strong.
Oh, isn’t it a beautiful thing to live and have some
one love you! I wish that you loved somebody; I
do not like to be so happy and have you standing
out in the cold. John thinks that <em>you</em> are wonderful;
I tell him that he will forget me when he has
heard you talk.
</p>
<p>
“Wise old Gus is a thousand miles over my head
when he talks to me, but John walks by my side
and speaks the thoughts that I have been thinking,
only in so much more beautiful language; and he
likes all the books I like, and my favorite poems
and hymns. How will you break it to Gus? He
must be told. He wrote to me two weeks ago, a
long, interesting letter all about Dunellen news,
which I haven’t dared answer yet. I suppose I
must. I showed it to John; he asked how old he
was, and now he calls him ‘The Venerable.’ He
must not keep on thinking about me, for I never,
never can like him, even if I never marry John.
Do break it to him in some easy, <em>pleasant</em> way; he
will never imagine that <em>you</em> know that he likes <em>me</em>.
He never showed it any, I am sure. I always
thought that it was you, and mother thinks so; I
heard her telling father.
</p>
<p>
“Be sure to write immediately, for I am as unhappy
as I can be. And be sure to tell me what
he says and how he takes it. Mary Sherwood wrote
me that Sue told her that she and Dr. Lake had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300'></a>300</span>
awful quarrels, and that once they didn’t speak to
each other for three days only in her father’s presence.
I never could quarrel with John. There he
comes. I’ll be writing when he comes in and not
look up, and then he will come behind my chair
and touch my curls when auntie isn’t looking.
</p>
<p>
“Write soon. Your ever loving <span class='sc'>Dine</span>.
</p>
<p>
“P.S.—John calls me Di: he doesn’t like <em>Dine</em>.”
</p>
<p>
Crumbling the letter in both hands, she laid it
upon the coals; then she stood with one foot on the
fender, leaning forward with her forehead upon the
mantel, thinking, thinking. Before she was aware
the door was opened and some one came behind
her and put both arms around her.
</p>
<p>
“Is any thing the matter with Dine?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no,” shaking herself loose from his arms
and creeping out of them.
</p>
<p>
He pushed the ottoman nearer and seated himself
upon the parrot and the roses; she stood on the
edge of the rug, with her arms folded across her
breast to keep herself quiet; how could she tell him
the truth? He was not a boy to laugh and cry and
fling it off; he had loved Dine as long as Felix Harrison
had loved <em>her</em>! He would take it quietly
enough; she had no dread of an outburst; it might
be that Dine’s silence in regard to his letter had
been a preparation; surely every hard thing that
came had its preparation; the heavy blow was
never sent before the word of warning.
</p>
<p>
“She is not sick?” he asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301'></a>301</span>
</p>
<p>
“Sick!” She lingered over the word as if help
would come before it were ended. “Oh, no, she is
well and happy.”
</p>
<p>
“Does she write you secrets?”
</p>
<p>
“She always tells me her secrets.”
</p>
<p>
“Has any phenomenon occurred?”
</p>
<p>
“It isn’t a phenomenon; it is something as old
as Eve and as new as Dinah. She thinks she has
found her Adam.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah!” in a constrained voice.
</p>
<p>
She saw nothing but the fire; the long poker was
laid across the fender, a handful of ashes had fallen
through the grate. “Such things have to come,
like the measles and mumps; I did hope, however,
to keep her out of the contagion. But Mother Nature
is wiser than any sister.”
</p>
<p>
“Why is it to be regretted?”
</p>
<p>
“Because—oh, because, I have learned that one’s
eyes are always wide open afterward—they weep
much and see clear; one can never be carelessly
happy again; I wanted her to stay a little girl. Selfishly,
perhaps. I thought there was time enough.”
</p>
<p>
“It is settled then—so soon?”
</p>
<p>
“Nothing is settled, but that two people are in
love, or believe themselves to be. Am I not a cynical
elder sister?”
</p>
<p>
“Is this her first experience?”
</p>
<p>
“Who can say when a first experience is! Tennyson
and moonlight walks are aggravating at their
age.” At their age! She felt as old as Miss Jewett
to-night.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302'></a>302</span>
</p>
<p>
“I hope he is worthy of her. She is a jewel.”
</p>
<p>
“She would not love him if he were not,” said
the elder sister proudly.
</p>
<p>
“This is a secret?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; I know that I can trust you. It will be
time enough to tell father and mother when he
brings her home and kneels at their feet for their
blessing.”
</p>
<p>
“Who is he?”
</p>
<p>
“John Woodstock, the school-master. He has
neither father nor mother, he is beautiful and good,
enthusiastic and fascinating.”
</p>
<p>
She had not once lifted her eyes to his face; his
fingers had clasped and unclasped themselves; his
voice was not as steady as usual.
</p>
<p>
“That notice was a very pretty puff, Lady Blue.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I like it I will paste it into my notebook.”
</p>
<p>
“Is that all you have seen?”
</p>
<p>
“No, I saw two in the reading-room, but I like
this better.”
</p>
<p>
“Are you writing now?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“You are not on the lookout for Adam.”
</p>
<p>
“No. I will write and he shall search for me.
Haven’t you heard of that bird in Africa, which if
you hunt for him, you can not find, but if you stay
at home, he will come to you?”
</p>
<p>
He had risen and stood in his usual uneasy fashion.
“My congratulations to Dine.”
</p>
<p>
“I will tell her.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303'></a>303</span>
</p>
<p>
He lingered on the hearth-rug, then at the door
with his hand upon the knob.
</p>
<p>
“Good night. I shall be busy for a week or two;
do not expect to see me.”
</p>
<p>
“You will come when you can?”
</p>
<p>
“Certainly.” He went out and closed the door.
</p>
<p>
She stood in the same position with her arms
folded for the next half hour. How could Dine
know what love was? How could she give up a
man like Gus Hammerton for a light-haired boy
who talked of making life a glorious success? He
had his heartache now; it had come at last after
all his years of watching Dine growing up: and no
one could help him, he must fight it out alone; she
remembered what he had said about quoting from
a book for Dr. Lake. What “book man” could
help him to-night? Would he open a book or fall
upon his knees?
</p>
<p>
Was <em>he</em> sorrowful to-night too, Ralph Towne?
How gentle he had been with her and how patient!
They had met several times since; once, in
his mother’s presence, when he had spoken to her
as easily as usual; at other times in the street; he
had lifted his hat and passed on; the one glimpse
of his eyes had been to reveal them very dark and
very stern. She could hear Mr. Hammerton’s voice
calling back to her father from the gate; they both
laughed and then his quick tramp sounded on the
planks.
</p>
<p>
The tramp kept on and on for hours; the moon
arose late; he walked out into the country, now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304'></a>304</span>
tramping along the wayside and now in the road;
it was midnight when he turned his face homeward
and something past one when he silently unlocked
the door with his night-key and found his way to
his room. There was a letter there from Dinah;
his sister had laid it on his bureau. It was brief,
formal, and ambiguous; she had subscribed herself
“Your young, old friend, D.” She did not say that
she was glad of his letter, she did not ask him to
write again. “She thinks that she must not write
to me,” he thought, “darling little Dine! I would
like to see that John Woodstock!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305'></a>305</span><a name='ch20' id='ch20'></a>XX.—SEVERAL THINGS.</h2>
<p>
The November sky was full of clouds; Tessa liked
a cloudy sky; the dried leaves whirled around her
and rustled beneath her feet, fastening themselves
to her skirt as she walked through them; she had
stepped down into the gutter to walk through the
leaves because they reminded her of her childish
days when she used to walk through them and soil
her stockings and endure a reprimand when her
mother discovered the cause of it; then she had
liked the sound of the leaves, now she only cared
for them, as she did for several other things,—for
the sake of the long ago past! She imagined herself
a ten-year-old maiden with big blue eyes and
long, bright braids hanging down her back and
tied together at the ends with brown ribbon; she
was coming from school with a Greenleaf’s Arithmetic
(she ciphered in long division and had a
“table” to learn), “Parker’s Philosophy” and “Magnall’s
Questions” in her satchel. The lesson to-morrow
in that was about Tilgath-pilneser; she had
stumbled over the queer name, so she would be
sure to remember it. There were crumbs in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306'></a>306</span>
napkin in the satchel, too, she had had seed cake
for lunch; and a lead pencil that Felix Harrison
had sharpened for her at noon, when he had come
down-stairs to ask Laura for his share of the lunch,
and there was a half sheet of note paper with her
spelling for to-morrow from “Scholar’s Companion”
written on it; perhaps there was a poorly written
and ill-spelled note from Gus Hammerton’s cousin,
Mary Sherwood, and there might be a crochet
needle and a spool of twenty cotton!
</p>
<p>
She smiled over the inventory, lingering over
each article; oh, if she only were going home from
school with that satchel, to help her mother a little,
play with Dine, and in the evening to look over her
lessons sitting close to her father and then to coax
him for a story. And then she would go to bed at
eight o’clock to awake in the morning to another
day. Mr. Hammerton said that it was a premature
“<em>Vanitas vanitatem</em>” for her to declare that “growing
up” was as bad as any thing a girl could dream!
</p>
<p>
But then he did not know about poor Felix, and
he could never guess what she had dreamed that
she had found in Ralph Towne—and how empty
life was because of this thing that had mocked her.
Empty with all its fulness because of something
that never had been; something that never could
be in him.
</p>
<p>
In those satchel-days her greatest trouble had
been an interminable scolding from her mother, or
the having to give to Dine her own share of cup-custard,
when one chanced to be left from tea.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307'></a>307</span>
</p>
<p>
It was a raw day; the wind played roughly with
her veil; the fields were bleak, and the long lines
of fence, stretching in every direction and running
into places that she did not know and would not
care for, gave her a feeling of homesickness. Homesickness
with the home she had lived in all her life
not a mile distant, with every one that she loved
or ever had loved within three miles; every one
but Dine, and Dine was as blithe and satisfied as
any girl could be.
</p>
<p>
Still she was homesick; she had been homesick
since that evening by the fire in Mrs. Towne’s sitting-room.
Homesick because she had dreamed a
dream that could never come true; now that he had
asked her in plain, straightforward, manly words
to love him and become his wife, her heart had
opened, the light shone in, and she read all that
the three years had written; she <em>had</em> loved him,
but the love had been crushed in shame—in shame
for her mistake.
</p>
<p>
“There she is <em>now</em>,” cried a voice in the distance
behind her.
</p>
<p>
She turned to find Dr. Lake stopping his horse;
he sprang out, not lightly, not like himself, and assisted
his wife to the ground.
</p>
<p>
“She prefers your company, it seems,” he said,
holding the reins with one hand and giving Tessa
the other. “Talk fast now, for I shall not be gone
long; I want to get home.”
</p>
<p>
“You can go home, I’ll come when I like,” replied
Sue.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308'></a>308</span>
</p>
<p>
“We stopped at your house,” said Sue, as he
drove on; “I asked him to leave me while he goes
to Harrison’s; that Felix is always having a fit or
something. Do you think Gerald looks so sick?”
squeezing her hand under the folds of Tessa’s crimson
and gray shawl that she might take her arm.
</p>
<p>
“He is much changed; I did not like to look at
him; has he been ill?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you didn’t hear then! It was day before
yesterday! He was thrown out; the horse ran
away; he isn’t hurt much; he thinks he is, I do believe.
I am not a nurse, I don’t know how to coddle
people and fuss over them. The horse is a
strange one that father had taken to try, and he
threw Gerald out and ran away and smashed the
buggy, and a farmer brought him home. He did
look as white as a sheet and he hasn’t eaten any
thing since; he went out yesterday and insisted
upon coming out to-day. Father says that he’s foolhardy;
but I guess he knows that he isn’t hurt; I
sha’n’t borrow trouble anyway. He mopes and feels
blue, but he says nothing ails him; he’s a doctor and
he ought to know. Where are you going?”
</p>
<p>
“Not anywhere in particular; I came out for the
air; we will walk on slowly.”
</p>
<p>
“We might go as far as your seat on the roots.
Wasn’t that time an age ago? I didn’t feel married-y
one bit. I want to go over to Sherwoods to-night
to the Sociable, but Gerald says that I am
heartless to want to go. I don’t think I am. I
didn’t get married to shut myself up. Gerald never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309'></a>309</span>
has any time to go anywhere with me, and it’s just
as stupid and vexatious at home as it ever was.
Don’t <em>you</em> ever get married.”
</p>
<p>
“Are you keeping your word?”
</p>
<p>
“What word?”
</p>
<p>
“The promise you made me that day by the
brook.”
</p>
<p>
“About Gerald? Oh, sometimes I keep it and
sometimes I don’t. He always makes up first, I
will say that for him. He will never let me go to
sleep without kissing him good night.”
</p>
<p>
“Then you did not tell Mary Sherwood that once
you did not speak for three days?”
</p>
<p>
“Bless you, no; Gerald would not let that be true;
it was no goodness in me that it wasn’t true, though;
perhaps I told her that.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you talk to her about him?”
</p>
<p>
“Now, Granny, suppose I do!”
</p>
<p>
Tessa stood still. “Promise me—you shall not
take another step with me till you do—that you
will not talk to any one against him.”
</p>
<p>
“I won’t. Don’t gripe my hand so tight. He is
my husband, he isn’t yours! When he’s contrary,
I’ll be contrary, too, and I’ll tell people if I like.”
</p>
<p>
“Then you forfeit my friendship; remember I am
not your friend.”
</p>
<p>
“Tessa Wadsworth! you hateful old thing! you
know I shall have to give in, for you are my best
friend! There,” laughing, “let me go, and I’ll promise!
I’ll say all the ugly things I have to say to his
own face.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310'></a>310</span>
</p>
<p>
They walked on slowly; Sue rambling on and
Tessa listening with great interest.
</p>
<p>
“I had a letter from Stacey last week; Gerald
has it in his pocket; he dictated the answer, and I
wrote it in my most flourishing style. I’ve got
somebody to take good care of me now—if he
doesn’t get sick! I don’t like sick people; I made
him some gruel yesterday and it was as thick as
mush. Oh, the things he promises me when he
gets rich! Gets rich! All he wants is for me to
love him, poor dear! What <em>is</em> love? Do you
know?”
</p>
<p>
“To discover is one of the things I live for; I
know that it suffers long.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s poetry! I don’t want to suffer long and
have Gerald sick. I had to get up last night and
make him a mustard plaster, and do you believe I
was so sleepy that I made it of ginger? He never
told me till this morning.”
</p>
<p>
In half an hour he drove up swiftly behind them.
</p>
<p>
“Susan, you can get in; I don’t feel like getting out
to help you. I feel very bad, I want to get home.”
</p>
<p>
He laid the reins in her hand. “You may drive;
good-by, Mystic; you and I will have our talk another
day.”
</p>
<p>
“Come and see us,” Sue shouted back.
</p>
<p>
The horse trotted on at good speed; Sue’s blue
veil floated backward; Tessa walked on thinking
of Dr. Lake’s pain-stricken face and figure.
</p>
<p>
Her first words to Mary Sherwood that evening
were:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311'></a>311</span>
</p>
<p>
“How is Dr. Lake?”
</p>
<p>
“Sick. Worse. Very sick, I suspect. Their girl
told our girl that Mrs. Lake was frightened almost
to death.”
</p>
<p>
“I hope she is,” said Nan Gerard, “she deserves
to be.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa kept herself in a sofa corner all the evening.
</p>
<p>
Nan said that she was a queen surrounded by
courtiers, for first one and then another came for a
quiet talk. When she was not talking or listening,
she was watching: figures, faces, voices, motions,
all held something in them worth her studying;
she had been watching under cover of a book of
engravings Professor Towne, for some time before
he came and stood at the arm of her sofa.
</p>
<p>
She was shy, at first, as she ever was with strangers,
but no one could be shy with him for a longer
time than five minutes. Dine’s last letter had contained
an account of an afternoon with Miss Towne,
with many quotations from her sayings.
</p>
<p>
“My sister thinks that your sister is a saint,” said
Tessa; “she has written me about her beautiful
life.”
</p>
<p>
“All about her invalids, I suppose. <em>Shut-ins</em>
she calls them! Invalids are her mania; she had
thirty-five on her list at her last writing; she finds
them north, south, east, and west.”
</p>
<p>
“Dine loves to hear about them; Miss Towne
gives her some of their letters to read to Aunt
Theresa. Dine runs over every morning to hear
about last night’s mail. I am looking forward to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312'></a>312</span>
my good times with her if she will be as good to
me as she is to my little sister.”
</p>
<p>
“She is looking forward to you; your sister’s enthusiasm
never flags when she may talk of you.”
</p>
<p>
The talk drifted into books; Mr. Hammerton
drew nearer, his questions and apt replies added
zest to the conversation; Tessa mentally decided
that he was more original than the Professor; the
Professor’s questions were good, but no one in all
<em>her</em> world could reply like Gus Hammerton; she
was proud of him to-night with a feeling of ownership;
in loving Dine, had he not become as near as
a brother to her?
</p>
<p>
This feeling of ownership was decidedly pleasant;
with it came a safe, warm feeling that she
was taken care of; that she had a right to be taken
care of and to be proud of him. No one in the
world, the most keen-eyed student of human nature,
could ever have guessed that he was suffering
from a heartache; he had greeted her with the
self-possession of ten years ago, had inquired about
the “folks at home,” and asked if Dine were up in
the clouds still. Could Dine have made a mistake?
Had she dreamed it?
</p>
<p>
Professor Towne moved away to go to Nan Gerard;
Tessa listened to Mr. Hammerton, he was telling
her about a discovery in science, and half comprehending
and not at all replying she watched
Professor Towne’s countenance and motions. She
could hear about this discovery some other time,
but she might not have another opportunity to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313'></a>313</span>
study the Professor. He was her lesson to-night.
As he talked, she decided that he did not so much
resemble his cousin as her first glance had revealed;
his voice was resonant, his manner more courteous;
he was not at all the “big boy,” he was dignified,
frank, and yet reserved; simple, at times, as his sister
might be, and cultured, far beyond any thing
she had ever thought of in regard to Dr. Towne;
he was as intellectual as Gus Hammerton, as gracious
as Felix Harrison, with as much heart as
Dr. Lake, a physical presence as fascinating as Dr.
Towne, and as pure-hearted and spiritualized as
only himself could be. She had found her ideal at
last. She had found him and was scrutinizing him
as coolly and as critically as if he were one of the
engravings in the book in her lap. She would
never find a flaw in him; when she wrote her
novel he should be her hero.
</p>
<p>
“Why, doctor! Have the skies fallen? Did you
hear that we were all taken with convulsions?”
</p>
<p>
Nan Gerard’s laugh followed this; the doctor’s
reply was cool and commonplace.
</p>
<p>
“What is the title of your book?” Mr. Hammerton
was asking. “‘Hepsey’s Heartache?’ ‘Jennie’s
Jumble?’ ‘Dora’s Distress?’ ‘Fannie’s Fancy?’ or it
may be ‘Up Top or Down Below,’ ‘Smashed Hopes
or Broken Idols.’”
</p>
<p>
“I will not answer you if you are not serious.”
</p>
<p>
“I thought that young ladies gloried in sentiment.”
</p>
<p>
She turned the leaves of her book.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314'></a>314</span>
</p>
<p>
“Lady Blue, I can not be a just critic; I can not
take a sentimental standpoint; you take it naturally
and truly; you are right to do so; it is your
mission, your calling, your election. Do not think
that I despise sentiment and the ideal world of
feeling—”
</p>
<p>
“You know that I do not think that,” she interrupted
earnestly.
</p>
<p>
“These questions of feeling can not be tackled
like a problem in mathematics, and an answer given
in cold, clear cut, adequate words; such a problem
I like to tackle; such an answer I like to give; but
these sentimental questions in ‘Blighted Hopes’ are
many sided, involved, and curvilinear; they are for
the theologian, metaphysician, and mystic. What
can you and I say about life’s hard questions after
Ecclesiastes and Job?”
</p>
<p>
“Then you think I am presuming?”
</p>
<p>
“Did I not just say that sentiment is your mission?
The story of each human life has a pathos
of its own, and each is an enigma of which God
only knows the solution.”
</p>
<p>
She colored and dropped her eyes; he did not
dream that she knew any thing of the “pathos” in
his life. How kind she would be to him!
</p>
<p>
“You are living your solution; perhaps you will
help me to find mine.”
</p>
<p>
“I can’t imagine any one in the world knowing
you well enough to be of any help to you.”
</p>
<p>
“Very likely; but I am not on a throne of rocks, in
a robe of clouds, crowned with a diadem of snow!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315'></a>315</span>
</p>
<p>
“It’s a little bit warm at the foot of Mount
Blanc,” she replied laughing.
</p>
<p>
“Then you shall live at the foot.”
</p>
<p>
“Dine and I,” she answered audaciously.
</p>
<p>
“Not Dine! She has gone away from us; she
would rather listen to a love-ditty from the lips of
her new acquaintance than a volume of sober sense
from us.”
</p>
<p>
“I had not thought to be jealous. She is not
taking any thing from me.”
</p>
<p>
“Be careful; never tell her any thing again; if
you write to her that Mary wears a black silk to-night,
and that Nan has geranium leaves in her
hair, she will run and tell him. She will never
keep another secret for you.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa looked grave. She never would be supreme
in her little sister’s heart again. Perhaps
this evening she had arrayed herself in garnet and
gone with him to the mite society, and was laughing
and playing games, fox and geese, or ninepins,
in somebody’s little whitewashed parlor, forgetting
that such a place as Dunellen was down upon the
map.
</p>
<p>
“Gus, we want you,” said Mary Sherwood, approaching
them. “The girls are having a quarrel
about who wrote something; now, go and tease
them to your heart’s content.”
</p>
<p>
“Wrote what?” asked Tessa.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I don’t know. Why are you so still? You
are sitting here as stately and grand and pale and
intellectual—one must be pale to look intellectual,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316'></a>316</span>
I suppose—as if you had written <em>Middlemarch</em>. I
thought that you never went home without a separate
talk with every person in the room, and there
you sit like a turtle in a shell. What change has
passed over the spirit of your dream?”
</p>
<p>
“I feel quiet; I feel as if I were afraid that some
one would push against me if I should attempt to
cross the room.”
</p>
<p>
Mary was called away and she drew herself into
her sofa corner; the two long rooms were crowded;
bright colors were flashing before her eyes, the
buzz and hum of merry talk filled her ears; a
black silk in contrast with a gray or blue cashmere;
a white necktie, a head with drooping curls,
a low, fair forehead, a pair of square shoulders in
broadcloth, an open mouth with fine teeth, sloping
shoulders of gray silk, a slender waist of brown, a
coat-sleeve with cuff and onyx cuff-button, a small
hand with a diamond on the first finger, and dark
marks of needle-pricks on the tip of the same finger,
a pearl ear-ring in a red, homely ear;—Tessa’s
eyes saw them all, as well as the rounded chin, the
fretful lip, the humorous lines at the corner of the
eye, the manner that was frank and the manner
that was intended to be, the lips that were speaking
truth and the lips that were dissembling, the
eyes that were contented and the eyes that were
missing something—a word, perhaps, or a little attention,
the eyes that brightened when some one
approached, the eyes that dropped because some
one was talking nonsense to some one else;—it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317'></a>317</span>
a rest to dwell upon these things and forget that
Dr. Lake was suffering and Sue frightened.
</p>
<p>
The gentlemen’s faces she did not scan; it was
fair, matured women like Mrs. Towne and Miss
Jewett, and sprightly, sweet girls like Nan Gerard
that she loved.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Towne was hedged in a corner, behind a
chair, conversing or seeming to converse with a
gentleman; he was not a lady’s man, he could not
be himself in the presence of a third or fourth
person, that is himself, socially; he could be himself
professionally under the gaze of the multitude.
Tessa smiled, thinking how uncomfortable he must
be and how he must wish himself at home. Was
he longing for his leisure at Old Place, where, as a
society man, nothing was expected of him? Did
he regret that he had come out “into the world”?
Was the old life in his “den” with his book a
dream that he would fain dream again? Perhaps
that book that had loomed up before her as containing
the wisdom of the ages was not such a
grand affair after all? Who had ever thought so
beside herself? Who had ever worshipped him as
hero and saint beside herself? He was not looking
like either, just now, for his face was flushed with
the heat of the room and he was standing in a
cramped position.
</p>
<p>
“The bear is in his corner growling,” said Nan
Gerard bending over her. “How ungracious he
can be when he wills. Sometimes he is positively
rude to me.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318'></a>318</span>
</p>
<p>
“Is there but one bear?”
</p>
<p>
“You know well enough whom I mean. I expect
that Mrs. Lake is mad enough because she
couldn’t come! How prettily she makes up; I
have seen her when she really looked elegant.
Homely girls have a way of looking prettier than
the pretty ones. How grave you are! You don’t
like my nonsense, do you?”
</p>
<p>
“I was thinking of poor Sue.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh yes; sad, isn’t it? She’ll be married in less
than two years, if he dies, see if she isn’t. I can’t
understand what her attraction is! She has a thousand
little airs, perhaps that is it. I am to sleep
with you to-night. May I?”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you,” said Tessa warmly, “I am very
glad.”
</p>
<p>
“There, the bear is looking at us. He’ll be over
here; now I’ll go over to the piano and see if I can
make him follow me; I’ve had great fun doing that
before now—<em>you</em> don’t do such things;” Nan shook
her curls back with a pretty movement, threw a
grave, alluring glance across the heads, and through
the lights at the bear, then moved demurely away.
</p>
<p>
The color touched his eyes; he looked amused
and provoked; Tessa saw it while her eyes were
busy with the lady in the chair near him; would
he follow her? Mr. Hammerton returned.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Why,&nbsp;&nbsp;William,&nbsp;&nbsp;on&nbsp;&nbsp;that&nbsp;&nbsp;old&nbsp;&nbsp;gray&nbsp;&nbsp;stone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus&nbsp;&nbsp;for&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;length&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;half&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why,&nbsp;&nbsp;William,&nbsp;&nbsp;sit&nbsp;&nbsp;you&nbsp;&nbsp;thus&nbsp;&nbsp;alone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And&nbsp;&nbsp;dream&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;time&nbsp;&nbsp;away?’<br />
</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319'></a>319</span></div>
<p>
Only six ladies have found their way to you in the
last half hour; with what sorcery do you draw them
towards you? Tessa,” speaking in a grave tone,
“it’s a beautiful thing for a woman to be attractive
to women!”
</p>
<p>
“It is a very happy thing.”
</p>
<p>
“Will you go to supper with me or do you prefer
to sit on the old gray stone? You once liked
to go with me to get rid of poor Harrison; is there
any one that you wish to rid yourself of now? In
these extremities I am at your service.”
</p>
<p>
“Are you taking me to rid yourself of a pertinacious
maiden?”
</p>
<p>
“No, the girls do not trouble me; I wish they
would; if Naughty Nan would only run after me,
now—there! there goes Towne; <em>he’s</em> after her, I
know.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa enjoyed the roguish, demure eyes with
which she made room for him at her side, and
flashed back a congratulation in return for the
little nod of triumph which Nan telegraphed to
her.
</p>
<p>
“You are in league, you two; I can see that with
my short-sighted eyes; say, you and he were prime
friends once, weren’t you?”
</p>
<p>
“We are now.”
</p>
<p>
“Humph! as they say in books! Why don’t <em>you</em>
bring him with your eyes, then?”
</p>
<p>
“What for?” she asked innocently.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, because he has money; he is a moral and
respectable young man, also.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320'></a>320</span>
</p>
<p>
“You are something of a phrenologist; tell me
what he is.”
</p>
<p>
“I will not. You will be thinking about him
instead of about me.”
</p>
<p>
“I will be thinking of your deep knowledge
of human nature, of your unrivalled penetration.
Don’t you know that a woman likes to hear one
man talk about another?”
</p>
<p>
“But you would not take my opinion, nevertheless.”
</p>
<p>
“True; I prefer my own unless yours confirm
mine. Tell me, please, what is he!”
</p>
<p>
“I have never given him five minutes’ thought.”
</p>
<p>
“You know his face; look away from him and
think.”
</p>
<p>
“He isn’t a genius; but he has brains,” replied
Mr. Hammerton slowly; “he is very quiet, as quiet
as any man you know; he is very gentle, his manner
is perfection in a sick room—and nowhere else,
I fancy—”
</p>
<p>
“That’s too bad.”
</p>
<p>
“Remember that I do not know him; I am speaking
as a phrenologist; I have never been introduced
to him. He does not understand human nature, he
could live a year under the roof with you or
me, particularly you, and not feel acquainted with
you; he is shy of women, he never knows whether
they are talking sense or nonsense; he is not a
lady’s man in the least, you may drop your handkerchief
and stoop for it, he would never know it.”
</p>
<p>
“Neither would you.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321'></a>321</span>
</p>
<p>
“He can keep a secret, that he can do to perfection.
Tell him that you are in love with him
and he will never, never tell! He is no musician.
Naughty Nan may break her wrists and the keys
of the piano, they will not unlock his ears or his
heart; he is not fluent in conversation, he states a
fact briefly, he answers a question exactly, he has
no more to say; but he is a good listener, he does
not forget; he is sympathetic, but he does not show
it particularly, very few would think that he has
any heart at all; I will wager that not two people
in the world know him, understand, or can easily
approach him; his temper is even, but when he <em>is</em>
angry ‘beware the fury of a patient man!’ He
likes to see things orderly; he seldom raises his
voice; he is exceedingly deliberate, and while he
<em>is</em> deliberating he would do or leave undone many
things that he would afterward regret. He will
rush into matrimony, or he will be in love for
years before he knows it; his temperament is bilious.
Now, Lady Blue, have I described a hero fit
for a modern romance?”
</p>
<p>
“No, only a commonplace man. All you have
said is literally true.”
</p>
<p>
“He is a <em>good</em> man,” said Mr. Hammerton, emphatically.
“I mean, good as men go, in these days.
Naughty Nan is to be congratulated. Do you not
think so?”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps,” said Tessa doubtfully.
</p>
<p>
“I believe that he is planning an attack on the
citadel under my charge; I will move off, and give
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322'></a>322</span>
him an opportunity; I want to talk to the Professor.”
</p>
<p>
How many years ago was it since Felix had attended
one of Mary Sherwood’s little parties? Not
more than three or four; she remembered how he
used to hear her voice in its lightest speaking, how
soon he became aware whenever she changed her
position; how many times she had raised her eyes
to meet his with their fixed, intense gaze; how his
eyes would glitter and what a set look would stiffen
his lips. And oh, how she had teased him in
those days by refusing his eagerly proffered attentions
and accepting Gus Hammerton in the matter-of-fact
fashion in which he had suggested himself
as ever at her service! In all the years she could
remember these two, Gus, helpful and friendly, not
in the least lover-like (she could as easily imagine
the bell on the old Academy a lover), and Felix,
poor Felix,—he would always be “poor Felix” now,—with
his burning jealousy and intrusive affection.
</p>
<p>
Was he asleep now, or awake and in pain? Was
he lying alone thinking of what he might have
been but for his own undisciplined eagerness, not
daring to look into the future nights and days,
that would be like these, only more helpless, more
terrible?
</p>
<p>
The talk and laughter ran on, her cheeks were
hot, her head weary; she longed for a cool pillow
and a dark chamber; some one was speaking, she
lifted her eyes to reply.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Tessa, my mother misses you every hour.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323'></a>323</span>
</p>
<p>
“I am very sorry. There is room on my sofa, will
you sit down?”
</p>
<p>
“No. I was too hasty in our last conversation,”
bending so low that his breath touched her hair,
“I come to ask you to reconsider; will you?”
</p>
<p>
“Do you want such an answer as that would
be?”
</p>
<p>
“That is what I do want; then you will be sure,
so sure that you will never change—”
</p>
<p>
“I am not changeable.”
</p>
<p>
“I think you are; in six months I will come to
you again, when shall it be?”
</p>
<p>
“So long! If you care, the suspense will be very
hard for you. I do not like to hurt you so.”
</p>
<p>
“I prefer the six months.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” speaking in her ordinary tone, “do not
come to me, wherever I may be—we may both be
in the next world by that time—”
</p>
<p>
“We shall not be so much changed as to forget,
shall we?”
</p>
<p>
“Or not to care? I will write you a letter on
the first day of June; I will mail it before ten
o’clock.”
</p>
<p>
She laid her hand in his; he held it a moment,
neither speaking.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you <em>are</em> here,” cried a voice.
</p>
<p>
And she was talking the wildest nonsense in two
minutes, with her eyes and cheeks aflame.
</p>
<p>
At half past one the last guests had departed;
Mary paused in a description of somebody’s dress
and asked Tessa if she would like to go to bed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324'></a>324</span>
</p>
<p>
“I have always wished to get near to you,”
said Nan, leading the way up-stairs. “I knew
that there was a place in your heart for me to
creep into.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa had a way of falling in love with girls;
that night she fell in love with Nan Gerard; sitting
on the carpet close to the register in a white
skirt and crimson breakfast sacque, bending forward
with her arms clasping her knees, she told Tessa the
story of her life.
</p>
<p>
Tessa was seated on the bed, still in the black
silk she had worn, with a white shawl of Shetland
wool thrown around her; she had taken the hair-pins
out of the hair and the long braid was brought
forward and laid across her bosom reaching far below
her waist.
</p>
<p>
She braided and unbraided the ends of it as Nan
talked about last winter and Dr. Towne.
</p>
<p>
“I like to talk to you; I can trust you, I wouldn’t
be afraid to tell you any thing; I can not trust Mary,
she exaggerates fearfully. I don’t mind telling <em>you</em>
that I came near falling in love with that handsome
black bear; it was only skin deep however;
I think that I have lost my attraction for him,
whatever it was; I never do take falling in love
hard; why, some girls take it as a matter of life
and death; I think the reason must be that I can
never love any one as I loved Robert. He was a
saint. Yes, he was; you needn’t look incredulous!
I am not sentimental, I am practical and I intend
to marry some day. People call me a flirt, perhaps
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325'></a>325</span>
I am, but my fun is very innocent and most
delightful.
</p>
<p>
“I know this: Ralph Towne would not like me if
I were the only girl in existence; he wants some
one who can think as well as talk; you wouldn’t
guess it to hear <em>him</em> talk, would you?
</p>
<p>
“Did you ever see a man who could not talk some
kind of nonsense? There’s Gus Hammerton, can’t
he talk splendid nonsense? Some of his nonsense
is too deep for me.
</p>
<p>
“Now, I’ve been trying an experiment with Dr.
Towne, he is such an old bear that I thought it
would do no harm; I made up my mind to see if
it were possible for a marriageable woman to treat
a marriageable man as if he were another woman!
I don’t know about it though,” she added ruefully.
</p>
<p>
“Has it failed?”
</p>
<p>
“I think it has—rather. He does not understand—”
</p>
<p>
“No man would understand.”
</p>
<p>
“I would understand if he would treat me as if
I were Nathan instead of Nan; what grand, good
friends we could be!”
</p>
<p>
“I am glad that you can see that it has failed.
How do you detect the failure?”
</p>
<p>
“I have eyes. I know. His mother does not
understand either. I think that I shall begin to
be more—”
</p>
<p>
“Maidenly?”
</p>
<p>
Nan colored. “Was I unmaidenly? I have resolved
never to ask him to take me anywhere again;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326'></a>326</span>
I have made him no end of pretty things, I will do
it no more. I would not like to have him lose his
respect for me.”
</p>
<p>
“It usually costs something to try an experiment;
I am glad that yours has cost you no more.”
</p>
<p>
“So am I, heartily glad. My next shall be of a
different nature. Did you never try an experiment?”
</p>
<p>
“Not of that kind; I tried an experiment once of
believing every thing that somebody said, and acting
upon it, as if it meant what it would have
meant to me.”
</p>
<p>
“And you came to grief?”
</p>
<p>
“I thought so, at first. Life <em>is</em> a long story, isn’t
it?”
</p>
<p>
“It’s an interesting one to me. I kept a journal
about <em>my</em> experiment; I’ll read it to you, shall I?”
</p>
<p>
“I would like it ever so much if you like <em>me</em> well
enough to do it.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course I do,” springing up. “And after I
read it to you, you shall write the ‘final’ for
me.”
</p>
<p>
In the top drawer of the bureau, she fumbled
among neckties, pocket-handkerchiefs, and a collection
of odds and ends, and at last, brought out a
small, soft-covered, thin book with edges of gilt.
</p>
<p>
“I named it ‘Nan’s Experiment,’” she said seriously,
reseating herself near the register. “If you
wish to listen in comfort, draw that rocker close to
me, and take off your boots and heat your feet.
If you are in a comfortable position, you will be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327'></a>327</span>
in a more merciful frame of mind to judge my
misdoings.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa obeyed, and leaned back in the cushioned
chair, braiding and unbraiding her hair as she
listened.
</p>
<p>
The journal opened with an account of the journey
by train to St. Louis. The description of her
escort was enthusiastic and girlish in the extreme.
</p>
<p>
“Is it nonsense?” the reader asked.
</p>
<p>
“Even if it were, I haven’t travelled so far away
from those days that I can not understand.”
</p>
<p>
She read with more confidence.
</p>
<p>
Ralph Towne would have been pleased with the
intentness of Tessa’s eyes and the softening of her
lips.
</p>
<p>
“You <em>dear</em> Naughty Nan,” cried Tessa, as the
book fell from the reader’s hands.
</p>
<p>
“Then you do not blame me so much?”
</p>
<p>
“It is only a mistake. Who does not make a
mistake? It sounds rather more than skin-deep,
though.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I had to throw in a little agony to make it
interesting. I don’t want him to think—”
</p>
<p>
“What he thinks is the price you pay for your
experiment.”
</p>
<p>
“Now write a last sentence, and I’ll keep it forever;
the names are all fictitious; no one can understand
it; I’ll find a pencil.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa held the pencil a moment. Nan on her
knees watched her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328'></a>328</span>
</p>
<p>
“Something that I shall remember all my life—whenever
I do a foolish thing—if I ever <em>do</em> again.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you know Jean Ingelow?”
</p>
<p>
“She is the one Professor Towne reads from?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. I will write some words of hers.”
</p>
<p>
The pencil wrote, and Nan, on her knees, read it
word by word.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I&nbsp;&nbsp;wait&nbsp;&nbsp;for&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;day&nbsp;&nbsp;when&nbsp;&nbsp;dear&nbsp;&nbsp;hearts&nbsp;&nbsp;shall&nbsp;&nbsp;discover,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While&nbsp;&nbsp;dear&nbsp;&nbsp;hands&nbsp;&nbsp;are&nbsp;&nbsp;laid&nbsp;&nbsp;on&nbsp;&nbsp;my&nbsp;&nbsp;head;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘The&nbsp;&nbsp;child&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;woman,&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;book&nbsp;&nbsp;may&nbsp;&nbsp;close&nbsp;&nbsp;over,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For&nbsp;&nbsp;all&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;lessons&nbsp;&nbsp;are&nbsp;&nbsp;said.’<br />
&#160;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I&nbsp;&nbsp;wait&nbsp;&nbsp;for&nbsp;&nbsp;my&nbsp;&nbsp;story—the&nbsp;&nbsp;birds&nbsp;&nbsp;can&nbsp;&nbsp;not&nbsp;&nbsp;sing&nbsp;&nbsp;it,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not&nbsp;&nbsp;one&nbsp;&nbsp;as&nbsp;&nbsp;he&nbsp;&nbsp;sits&nbsp;&nbsp;on&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;tree;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;bells&nbsp;&nbsp;can&nbsp;&nbsp;not&nbsp;&nbsp;ring&nbsp;&nbsp;it,&nbsp;&nbsp;but&nbsp;&nbsp;long&nbsp;&nbsp;years,&nbsp;&nbsp;O&nbsp;&nbsp;bring&nbsp;&nbsp;it!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such&nbsp;&nbsp;as&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;wish&nbsp;&nbsp;it&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;be.”<br />
</p>
<p>
“Thank you, very much. You write a fine hand.
‘Such as I wish it to be?’ No one’s story is ever
that—do you think it ever is?”
</p>
<p>
“We will do our best to make ours such as we
wish it to be.”
</p>
<p>
“Professor Towne is to have a private class in
elocution after the holidays, and I’m going to join.
He says that I will make a reader. I wish that you
would join too.”
</p>
<p>
“I wish I might, but I shall not be at home; I
am to spend a part of the winter away.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, are you? Just as I have found you. But
you promise to write to me?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I will write to you; I beg of you not to
try any experiments with me,” she added laughing.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t be afraid,” said Nan, seriously.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329'></a>329</span>
</p>
<p>
“I wish you would make a friend of Miss Jewett;
you will be glad of it as long as you live.”
</p>
<p>
“I am doing it; but I don’t want <em>you</em> to go away.”
</p>
<p>
“I shall come back some day, childie.”
</p>
<p>
Nan moved nearer, still on her knees, drew Tessa’s
cheek down to her lips,—her warm, saucy, loving
lips,—saying, “My counsellor.”
</p>
<p>
Dr. Greyson’s house stood opposite. Tessa went
to the window to see if the light were still burning
in Sue’s chamber; Sue had forgotten to drop the curtains;
the room was well-lighted; Sue was standing
in the centre of the room holding something in her
hand; Tessa saw Dr. Greyson enter and Sue moved
away.
</p>
<p>
She lay in bed wide awake watching the light.
</p>
<p>
“Good-by, Mystic; you and I will have our talk
another day.”
</p>
<p>
The tears dropped slowly on the pillow.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330'></a>330</span><a name='ch21' id='ch21'></a>XXI.—THROUGH.</h2>
<p>
The snow-flakes were very large, they fell leisurely,
melting almost as soon as they touched Tessa’s
flower bed; she was sitting at one of the sitting-room
windows writing. She wrote, as it is
said that all ladies do, upon her lap, her desk being
a large blank book; her inkstand stood upon
the window-sill; the cane-seated chair in front of
her served several purposes, one of them being a
foot-rest; upon the chair were piled “Roget’s Thesaurus
of English Words and Phrases,” “Recreations
of a Country Parson,” a Bible, the current
numbers of the <em>Living Age</em> and <em>Harper’s Magazine</em>,
and George Macdonald’s latest book.
</p>
<p>
Her wrapper was in two shades of brown, the
ruffle at her throat was fastened by a knot of blue
velvet; in one brown pocket were a lead pencil, a
letter from an editor, who had recently published
a work upon which he had been busy twenty years
and had thereby become so famous that the letter
in her pocket was an event in her life, especially
as it began: “My dear Miss Tessa, I like your letter
and I like you.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331'></a>331</span>
</p>
<p>
Her father was very proud of that letter.
</p>
<p>
In the other brown pocket were a tangle of pink
cord, a half yard of tatting, and a shuttle, and—what
Tessa had read and reread—three full sheets
of mercantile note from Miss Sarepta Towne.
</p>
<p>
Dinah was seated at another window embroidering
moss roses upon black velvet; the black velvet
looked as if it might mean a slipper for a good-sized
foot. There was a secret in the eyes that
were intent upon the roses; the secret that was
hidden in many pairs of eyes—brown, blue, hazel—in
Dunellen in these days before Christmas.
</p>
<p>
There was not even the hint of a secret in the
eyes that were opening “Thesaurus” and looking
for a synonym for <em>Information</em>.
</p>
<p>
“Poor Tessa!” almost sighed happy Dinah, “she
has to plod through manuscript and books, and
doesn’t know half how nice it is to make slippers.”
</p>
<p>
Poor Tessa closed her book just then and looked
out into the falling snow.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps we shall hear that he’s dead to-day,”
said Dinah, brushing a white thread off the velvet.
“I have expected to hear that every day for a
week.”
</p>
<p>
“But you said that he talked real bright last
week.”
</p>
<p>
“So Sue said. I have not seen him. He knows
that I have called, that is enough; I do not want
to see him, I know that my face would distress
him.”
</p>
<p>
“Poor fellow,” said Dine, compassionately, “how
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332'></a>332</span>
he used to talk! The stories that he has told in
this room. Oh, Tessa, I can’t be thankful enough
for every thing! To think that John should get
such a good position in the Dunellen school! How
things work around; he would not have had it but
for Mr. Lewis Gesner! John and I are going there
to spend the evening next week; Miss Gesner asked
him to bring me. And oh, Tessa, <em>do</em> you think that
Gus takes it much to heart?”
</p>
<p>
“If I did not know I should not think that he
had any thing to take to heart!”
</p>
<p>
“I suppose his heart bleeds in secret,” said Dinah
pensively. “Well, it isn’t <em>my</em> fault. You don’t
blame me.”
</p>
<p>
“I never blame any one.”
</p>
<p>
“Father and mother are very polite to John.”
</p>
<p>
“They are never rude to any one.”
</p>
<p>
“Say, Tessa, are you glad about me, or sorry?”
</p>
<p>
“Am I not always glad about you?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, about John?”
</p>
<p>
“I like John; he is a good boy; but you can not
expect me not to be disappointed about Gus!”
</p>
<p>
“You think that Gus is every thing.”
</p>
<p>
“I think that he is <em>enough</em>.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps—perhaps—” but Dinah became confused
and dared not finish.
</p>
<p>
Tessa felt her thought. Perhaps—but what a
queer perhaps; who could imagine it?
</p>
<p>
The sharp Faber scribbled upon waste paper for
some minutes; it scribbled dates and initials and
names, and then “Such as I wish it to be.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333'></a>333</span>
</p>
<p>
“There goes Dr. Towne,” said Dinah.
</p>
<p>
Tessa lifted her head in time for a bow. Then
she scribbled, “A nightingale made a mistake.”
</p>
<p>
The letter in her pocket had closed thus: “You
have the faculty of impressing truth in a very
pleasant manner; your characters are spirited, your
incidents savor of freshness, your style is rather
abrupt however, it will be well to consider that.”
</p>
<p>
A busy life, busy in the things that she loved
best, was her ideal of happiness.
</p>
<p>
She scribbled—“Dec. 15. Dinah making roses.
Miss Towne wishing for me. Is any one else?
What do I wish? My naughty heart, be reasonable,
be just, be sure, do not take a thing that you
<em>want</em>, just because you want it.”
</p>
<p>
Dinah was wondering how Tessa’s face <em>could</em> look
so peaceful when she was not engaged nor likely to
be. Tessa was at peace, she was at rest concerning
Dr. Lake. Before the storm was over, he would be
glad that he had been born into a life upon the
earth. In this hour—while Dine was working her
roses and Tessa scribbling, while the snow-flakes
were melting on Dr. Towne’s overcoat and Nan
Gerard was studying “The Songs of Seven” to
read to the Professor that evening—Sue and her
husband were alone in Sue’s chamber.
</p>
<p>
“Sue, I haven’t heard you sing to-day.”
</p>
<p>
“How can I sing, Gerald, when you are so sick?”
</p>
<p>
“Am I so sick? Do you know that I am?”
</p>
<p>
“I think I ought to know; don’t I see how father
looks? and didn’t Dr. Towne say that he would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334'></a>334</span>
come and stay with you to-night? Are not people
very sick when they have a consultation?”
</p>
<p>
“Sometimes. What are you doing over there?”
</p>
<p>
“It is time for your powder; you must sleep,
they all say so. Will you try to go to sleep after
you take this?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, if you will sing to me.”
</p>
<p>
He raised himself on his elbow and took the
spoon from her hand. “You have been a good
wife to me, Susan.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course I have. Isn’t that what I promised.
There, you spilled some; how weak your fingers
are! you are like a baby. I don’t like babies.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t say that,” falling back upon the pillow.
“I want you to be womanly, dear, and true women
love babies.”
</p>
<p>
“They are such a bother.”
</p>
<p>
“So are husbands.”
</p>
<p>
“When you get well, you will not be a bother!
Can’t you talk any louder?”
</p>
<p>
“Sit down close to me. How long have I been
sick?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I don’t know! The nights and days are
just alike.”
</p>
<p>
“I expect that you are worn out. We will go to
sleep together. I wish we could.”
</p>
<p>
“You mustn’t talk, you must go to sleep.”
</p>
<p>
“Say, Susan,” catching her hand in both his,
“are you glad you married me?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course I am glad; that is, I shall be when
you get well.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335'></a>335</span>
</p>
<p>
“You wouldn’t like a feeble husband dragging
on you all your days, would you?”
</p>
<p>
“No, I <em>wouldn’t</em>. Who would? Would you like
a feeble wife dragging on <em>you</em> all your days?”
</p>
<p>
“I would like <em>you</em>, sick or well.”
</p>
<p>
“I knew you would say that. You and Tessa
and Dr. Towne are sentimental. What do you
think he said to me last night. ‘Be very gentle
and careful with him, do not even speak loud.’”
</p>
<p>
“He is very kind.”
</p>
<p>
“As if I <em>wouldn’t</em> be gentle!”
</p>
<p>
“Bring your chair close and sing.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t feel like singing; this room is dark and
hot, and I am sleepy.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, never mind.”
</p>
<p>
She pushed a chair close to the low bed and sat
down; he took her hand and held it between his
flushed hot hands. “God bless you forever, and
ever, my darling wife!”
</p>
<p>
“That’s too solemn,” said Sue in an awed voice;
“don’t say such things; I shall believe that you
are going to die, if you do. Do go to sleep, that’s
a good boy.”
</p>
<p>
He laid his finger on his wrist keeping it there a
full minute.
</p>
<p>
“Are you stronger?” she asked eagerly. “Father
will not say when I ask him and Dr. Towne
only looked at me.”
</p>
<p>
He lifted her hand to his lips and smiled.
</p>
<p>
“Now sing.”
</p>
<p>
“What shall I sing?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336'></a>336</span>
</p>
<p>
“Any thing. Every thing. ‘Jesus, lover of my
soul.’ I always liked that.”
</p>
<p>
The clear, strong voice trembled nervously over
the first words; she was afraid, but she did not
know what she was afraid of; his eyelids drooped,
he kept tight hold of her hand.
</p>
<p>
She sang the hymn through and then asked what
he would like next.
</p>
<p>
“I was almost dreaming. Sue is a pretty name,
so is Gerald; but I would not like my boy to be
named Gerald. Theodore means the <em>gift of God</em>; I
like that; Theodore or Theodora. If you ever name
a child, will you remember that?”
</p>
<p>
“I shall never name a child; I don’t like children
well enough to fuss over them. Now, what else?”
</p>
<p>
“‘Jerusalem the golden.’”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you don’t want that! It’s too solemn. I
won’t sing it, I’ll sing something livelier. Don’t
you like ‘Who are these in bright array?’”
</p>
<p>
The eyelids drooped, he did not loosen his clasp,
and she sang on; once, when she paused, he whispered,
“Go on.”
</p>
<p>
The snow fell softly, melting on the window-sill,
the wood fire burnt low, she drew her hand away
and went to the stove to put in a stick of wood;
he did not stir, his hands were still half-clasped;
through the half-shut lids, his eyes shone dim and
dark. She was very weary; she laid her head
on the white counterpane near his hands and fell
asleep. Dr. Greyson entered, stood a moment near
the door and went out; Dr. Towne came to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337'></a>337</span>
threshold, his eyes filled as he stood, he closed the
door and went down-stairs; he opened the front
parlor door, thinking of the two as they stood
there together such a little time since, and thinking
of Tessa’s face as he saw it that morning.
“She will love him always if he leaves her now,”
he said to himself; “when she is old, she will look
back and grieve for him. Tessa would, but Sue—there’s
no reckoning upon her. Why are not all
women like Tessa and my mother?”
</p>
<p>
He drove homeward, thinking many thoughts;
of late, in the light of Tessa’s words, he could behold
himself as she beheld him; she would have
been satisfied, could she have known the depth of
his self-accusation; “No man but a fool could <em>be</em>
such a fool,” he had said to himself more than
once. “There is no chance that she will take me.”
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Sue awoke from her heavy sleep; it
was growing colder, the snow was falling and not
melting, the room was quite dark.
</p>
<p>
“I have been asleep,” said Dr. Lake.
</p>
<p>
“And now you are better,” cried Sue, joyfully.
“I knew that you were moping and had the blues.”
</p>
<p>
Through that night and the next day, Miss Jewett
watched with Sue; before another morning
broke, Sue—poor widowed Sue!—was taken in
hysterics from the room.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338'></a>338</span><a name='ch22' id='ch22'></a>XXII.—SEVERAL OTHER THINGS.</h2>
<p>
Tessa dropped the curtains, arranged the heavy
crimson folds, and lighted the gas.
</p>
<p>
“I shall do this many times in my imagination
before spring,” she said. “The curtains in my
room, Dine says, are Turkey red, and my gas will
be one tall sperm candle. Just about twilight you
will feel my ghost stealing in, the curtains will fall,
and invisible hands play among them, the jets will
start into light, and then the perfume of a kiss
will touch your forehead and hair. The perfume
shall be that of a pansy or a day-lily, as you prefer.”
</p>
<p>
“I would rather have your material lips; I am
not fond of ghostly visitants; I shall feel you always
beside me; I shall not forget you even in
my sleep.”
</p>
<p>
“You are too kind to me,” said Tessa, after a
moment, during which she had donned her brown
felt hat and buttoned her long brown cloth cloak.
The feeble old lady in the arm-chair flushed like a
girl under the gratitude of Tessa’s eyes; her eyes
filled slowly as Tessa came to her and kissed her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339'></a>339</span>
</p>
<p>
“I am very old womanish about you; it must be
because I am not strong; I would never let you go
away out of my presence if I could hinder it.”
</p>
<p>
“I want to stay with you; I am never happier
than I am in this room; but I must go; it is a
promise; and I must go to-morrow. Uncle Knox
will meet me at the train with a creaky old buggy
and a half-blind white horse; then we shall drive
six miles through a flat country with farm-houses
scattered here and there to a cunning little village
containing one church and one store and about
forty dwellings. Our destination is a small house
near the end of the principal street where live the
most devoted old couple in the world! Aunt Theresa
and Uncle Knox are a pair of lovers; it is
beautiful to see them together; it is worth travelling
across the continent; they never forget each
other for an instant, and yet they make no parade
of their affection; I am sure that they will both
die upon the same day of the same disease. Their
life is as lovely as a poem. I have often wondered
how they attained it, if it were perfect before
they were married or if it <em>grew</em>.”
</p>
<p>
She was standing under the chandelier buttoning
her gloves, with her earnest face towards the
lady in the arm-chair.
</p>
<p>
“It <em>grew</em>,” said a voice behind her. Dr. Towne
had entered unperceived by either. “Is that all?”
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t that enough?” she asked slightly flushing.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I think that it is enough; but I know that
it was born and not made. It did not become perfect
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340'></a>340</span>
in a year and a day. See if your aunt hasn’t
had an experience that she will not tell you.”
</p>
<p>
“And my uncle?” she asked saucily.
</p>
<p>
“Men do not parade their experiences.”
</p>
<p>
“Providing they have any to parade,” she replied
lightly. “I’m afraid that I don’t believe in men’s
experiences.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t say that, my dear,” said Mrs. Towne anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“I will not,” Tessa answered, suddenly sobered,
“not until I forget Dr. Lake.”
</p>
<p>
“Am I to have the mournful pleasure of taking
you home, Miss Tessa? My carriage is at the door.”
</p>
<p>
“I have tried to persuade her to stay all the
evening,” said Mrs. Towne.
</p>
<p>
“I have an engagement. My encyclopedia is
coming to-night to talk over to me something that
I have been writing.”
</p>
<p>
“Is he your critic?” inquired Dr. Towne.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and an excellent one, too. Don’t you
know that he knows every thing?”
</p>
<p>
“Then perhaps he can tell me something that I
want to know. Would it be safe to ask him?”
</p>
<p>
“If it is to be found in a book he can tell you,”
said Tessa seriously.
</p>
<p>
“It is not to be found in any poem that was ever
written or in any song that was ever sung.”
</p>
<p>
“Then it remains to be written?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; don’t you want to write it?”
</p>
<p>
“I must learn it by heart first; I can not write
what I have not learned.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341'></a>341</span>
</p>
<p>
“Ralph, you shall not tease her,” interrupted his
mother, “she shall not do any thing that she does
not please.”
</p>
<p>
“Not even go into the country for three months
in winter,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“What will Sue do without you, Tessa?” asked
Mrs. Towne.
</p>
<p>
“I have been with her five days; she cried and
clung to me. I do not want to leave her, there are
so many reasons for me to stay and so few for me
to go. Miss Gesner came this afternoon and promised
to stay all night with her. She is a little
afraid of Miss Gesner; with Miss Jewett and me,
she cried and talked about him continually; the
poor girl is overwhelmed.”
</p>
<p>
“She will be overwhelmed again by and by,”
said Dr. Towne.
</p>
<p>
“Ralph! I never heard you say any thing so
harsh of any one before.”
</p>
<p>
“Is truth harsh?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“If it be mild to-morrow, I will go to Sue; I will
take her down to Old Place for a month; she always
throve there.”
</p>
<p>
“She will be dancing and singing in a month,”
returned Dr. Towne.
</p>
<p>
“Well, let her!”
</p>
<p>
“But you must not be troubled, mother. I shall
make her promise not to talk to you and go into
hysterics.”
</p>
<p>
“My son, she is a widow.”
</p>
<p>
“‘And desolate,’” he quoted.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342'></a>342</span>
</p>
<p>
“Tessa, will you write to me every week, child?”
</p>
<p>
“Every week,” promised Tessa, as she was drawn
into the motherly arms and kissed again and again.
</p>
<p>
Her own mother would not kiss her like that.
Was it her mother’s fault or her own?
</p>
<p>
As soon as they were seated in the carriage
and the robe tucked in around her, her companion
asked, “Shall we drive around the square? The
sun is hardly set and the air is as warm as autumn.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” she answered almost under her breath.
In a moment she spoke hurriedly, “Does your
mother think—does she know—”
</p>
<p>
“She is a woman,” he answered abruptly.
</p>
<p>
“I wish—oh, I wish—” she hesitated, then added—“that
she would not love me so much.”
</p>
<p>
“It <em>is</em> queer,” he said gravely.
</p>
<p>
They drove in silence through the town and
turned into the “mountain road”; after half a
mile, they were in the country with their faces
towards the glimmer of light that the sunset had
left.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Tessa, my mother believes in me.”
</p>
<p>
“I know that.”
</p>
<p>
“You do not weigh my words sufficiently. They
do not mean enough to you.”
</p>
<p>
“Is that so very strange?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, it is strange when I tell you that I know
I was a fool! When I tell you that I have repented
in dust and ashes. I did not understand
you, nor myself, a year ago—I am dull about understanding
people. I think that I am not quick
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343'></a>343</span>
about any thing; I can not make a quick reply; I
have labored at my studies; I was not brilliant in
school or college; I am very slow, but I am very
<em>sure</em>. If you had been as slow as I, our friendship
would never have had its break; you were too
quick for me; but you understood me long before
I understood myself; I did not understand myself
until I was withdrawn from you. Do you believe
that?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I believe it. But you should have waited
until you <em>did</em> understand.”
</p>
<p>
“It is rather tough work for a man to confess
himself a fool.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa said nothing.
</p>
<p>
“I do not ask to be excused, I ask to be forgiven;
to be borne with. Will you be patient with
me?”
</p>
<p>
“I do not know how to be patient. I am too
quick. I have been very bitter and unjust towards
you; I judged you as if you were as quick as I am;
I have even wished you dead; it does not do for us
to be in a class together.”
</p>
<p>
“Not in the short run; we haven’t tried the long
run yet, and you are afraid to do that?”
</p>
<p>
“I suppose I am. I am afraid of something; I
think that I am afraid of myself.”
</p>
<p>
“If you are not afraid of me, I do not care what
you are afraid of.”
</p>
<p>
“I am not afraid of you—now.”
</p>
<p>
“Then if you do—reject me, it is because you are
not satisfied with your heart toward me?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344'></a>344</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes, that will be the reason,” she said slowly.
</p>
<p>
“And none other?”
</p>
<p>
“There is no reason in yourself; now that you
have seen how you were wrong; the reason will all
be in myself.”
</p>
<p>
“Are you coming any nearer to an understanding
with yourself?” he asked quietly.
</p>
<p>
He had spoken in this same tone to a patient, a
little child, not two hours since.
</p>
<p>
The tone touched her more deeply than the words.
</p>
<p>
“I do not know. I am trying not to reason. I
have worn myself out with reasoning. You are
very still, but I know that this time is terrible to
you; as terrible as last year was to me! Believe
me, I am not lightly keeping you in suspense.
Truly I can not decide. There is some hindrance;
I do not know what it is.”
</p>
<p>
“I do not wish to hurry you; you shall have a
year to decide if you prefer. It is very sudden to
you; you need time and quiet to recover from the
shock; you are very much shaken. You are not as
strong as you were two years ago. The strain has
been too great for you; when you have decided once
for all time and all eternity, your eyes will look as
they looked two years ago. All I ask you is be <em>sure</em>
of <em>yourself</em>! I promise not to trouble you for a year;
I am sorry to be troubling you now. Are you very
unhappy?”
</p>
<p>
She was trembling and almost crying.
</p>
<p>
“You shall not answer me, or think of answering
me until you are ready; I deserve to suffer; I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345'></a>345</span>
do not fear the issue of your self-analysis; when you
have recovered from the shock and can <em>feel</em> that you
have forgiven me, then you will know whether you
love me, whether you trust me. Will you write
to me?”
</p>
<p>
“No, sir.”
</p>
<p>
He laughed in spite of his vexation; she resented
the laugh; he was altogether too sure of his power.
</p>
<p>
“You must not be so sure,” she began.
</p>
<p>
“I shall be just as sure as—<em>you</em> please.”
</p>
<p>
“You think that I am very perplexing.”
</p>
<p>
“You are full of freaks and whims; you are a
Mystic. Dr. Lake truly named you. I used to
think you a bundle of impulses, and now I find you
sternly adhering to a principle. If your whim be
founded on principle, and I verily believe it is, I
honor you even when I am laughing at you.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t laugh at me; I am too miserable to bear
that. Be patient with me as if I were ill.”
</p>
<p>
“You are not strong enough to go from home.
If you do not feel well, will you write for me to
come and bring you home?”
</p>
<p>
“I am well enough.”
</p>
<p>
“Promise me, please.”
</p>
<p>
“I can not promise,” she answered decidedly.
</p>
<p>
They were neither of them in a mood for further
talk; she felt more at rest than she had felt for two
years; there was nothing to think of, nothing to be
hurried about; she had a whole year to be happy
in, and then—she would be happy then, too. As
for him—she could not see his face, for they had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346'></a>346</span>
turned into the cross-road, thickly wooded, that
opened into the clearing before the gates of Old
Place.
</p>
<p>
He spoke to his horse in his usual tone, “Gently,
Charlie.” He stooped to wrap the robe more
closely about her feet; as he raised himself, she
slipped her ungloved hand into his. “Don’t be
troubled about me, I will not be troubled; I will
not reason; but don’t be sure; perhaps when the
year is over I shall not be satisfied.”
</p>
<p>
“Then you must take another year.”
</p>
<p>
“You will not be so patient with me another
year; I shall not take another year.”
</p>
<p>
“Tessa, you are a goose; but you are a darling,
nevertheless.”
</p>
<p>
“You do not understand me,” she said, withdrawing
her hand.
</p>
<p>
“I am too humble to expect ever to do that.
You have never seen our home. Is it too late to
go over the place to-night?”
</p>
<p>
“I will go with your mother some time; she has
described every room to me.”
</p>
<p>
“Who is that fellow that you were engaged to?”
</p>
<p>
“He is not a fellow.”
</p>
<p>
“Who is he?”
</p>
<p>
“Felix Harrison.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah!” Then after a pause, “Tell me the whole
story.”
</p>
<p>
The whole story was not long; she began with his
school-boy love, speaking in short sentences, words
and tone becoming more intense as she went on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347'></a>347</span>
</p>
<p>
“I did not mean to be so wrong; but I was so
unhappy and he cared—”
</p>
<p>
“What shall I do without you all winter?”
</p>
<p>
“What have you done without me every winter?”
she asked merrily.
</p>
<p>
With an effort she drew herself away from the
arm that would have encircled her. Morbidly fearful
of making another mistake, she would not answer
his words or his tone.
</p>
<p>
“The witches get into me at night,” she said,
soberly, “and I say things that I may regret in
the sunlight.”
</p>
<p>
“It is not like you to regret speaking truth.
Remember, I do not exact any promise from you;
but if the time ever come that you know you love
me, I want you to tell me so.”
</p>
<p>
“I will.”
</p>
<p>
He drove up under the maple trees, before the
low iron fence, as he had done on the last night
of the old year; another old year was almost ended;
they stood holding each other’s hand, neither caring
to speak.
</p>
<p>
Ralph Towne would not have been himself, if he
had not bent and kissed her lips; and she would
not have been herself, had she not received it
gravely and gladly. After that it was not easy
to go in among the talkers and the lights; she
stood longer than a moment on the piazza, schooling
herself to bear scrutiny, to answer with unconcern;
still she felt dizzy and answered the first
questions rather at random.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348'></a>348</span>
</p>
<p>
“Going around in the dark has set your wits to
wool-gathering,” said her mother.
</p>
<p>
“We waited tea,” said Dinah.
</p>
<p>
“You did not come alone, daughter?” asked her
father.
</p>
<p>
“No, sir. Dr. Towne brought me.”
</p>
<p>
“We are very hungry,” said Mr. Hammerton.
</p>
<p>
“We will talk over the book before chess, Gus,
if you please. I have some packing to do, and I
am very tired.”
</p>
<p>
“How is Sue?” inquired her mother.
</p>
<p>
“Very well.”
</p>
<p>
“Is she taking it hard?”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps. I do not know what hard is.”
</p>
<p>
“Is her mourning all ready?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes’m.”
</p>
<p>
“A young widow is a beautiful sight,” observed
Mrs. Wadsworth pathetically.
</p>
<p>
“Probably some one will think so,” said Mr.
Hammerton, speaking quickly to save Tessa from
replying.
</p>
<p>
“Take off your things, Tessa,” said Dinah. “I
want my supper.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s <em>his</em> night, isn’t it?” asked Mr. Hammerton,
teasingly; Dinah colored, looked confused, and ran
down-stairs to ring the tea-bell.
</p>
<p>
The door-bell clanged sharply through the house
as they were rising from the table. “I was young
myself once,” remarked Mr. Hammerton.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t believe it,” retorted Dinah, putting her
hands instinctively up to her hair.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349'></a>349</span>
</p>
<p>
“You’ll do, run along,” laughed her father.
“Oh, how old I feel to see my little girls becoming
women.”
</p>
<p>
“I should think Tessa would feel old,” replied
Mrs. Wadsworth, significantly.
</p>
<p>
“I do,” said Tessa, rising. “Where is your criticism,
Mr. Critic; I have some packing to do to-night,
so you may cut me to pieces before chess.”
</p>
<p>
“No matter about chess,” said Mr. Wadsworth.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, it is; I will not be selfish.”
</p>
<p>
“Then run up and talk over your bookish talk,
mother and I will come up presently.”
</p>
<p>
The sitting-room was cozy and home-like, even
after the luxury of Mrs. Towne’s handsome apartment.
“I don’t want to go away,” sighed Tessa,
dropping into a chair near the round black-and-green
covered table. “Why can’t people stay at
home always?”
</p>
<p>
“Why indeed?” Mr. Hammerton moved a chair
to her side and seating himself carelessly threw an
arm over the back of her chair.
</p>
<p>
How many evenings they had read and studied
in this fashion, with Dine on a low stool, her curly
head in her sister’s lap.
</p>
<p>
“They will never come again.”
</p>
<p>
“What?” asked Tessa opening the long, yellow
envelope he had taken from his pocket.
</p>
<p>
“The old days when you and Dine and I will not
want any one else.”
</p>
<p>
“True; Dine has left us already.”
</p>
<p>
“But you and I are content without her!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_350'></a>350</span>
</p>
<p>
“Are we? I am not sure! Gus your penmanship
is perfect; when I am rich, you shall copy my
books.”
</p>
<p>
“How rich?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, rich enough to give you all you would ask,”
she answered thoughtlessly. “I expect that I shall
have to undergo a process as trying as vivisection;
but I will not flinch; it is good for me.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t read it now; save it for the solitude of
the country.”
</p>
<p>
“No, I am anxious to see it; you can be setting
up the chess-men; I don’t want to take you away
from father.”
</p>
<p>
With the color rising in his cheeks, he arose and
moved the chess-board nearer; standing before her,
he began slowly to arrange the pieces. The three
large sheets were closely written; she read slowly,
once breaking into a laugh and then knitting her
brows and drawing her lips together.
</p>
<p>
“Are you not pleased? Am I not just?”
</p>
<p>
“A critic is not a fault-finder, necessarily; you
are very plain. I will consider each sentence by
itself in my solitude; you are a great help to me,
Gus. I thank you very much. You have been a
help to me all my life.”
</p>
<p>
“I have tried to be,” he answered, taking up a
castle and turning it in his fingers.
</p>
<p>
“I will rewrite my book, remembering all your
suggestions.”
</p>
<p>
“You remember that Tennyson rewrote ‘Dora’
four hundred and forty-five times, that Victor Hugo
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351'></a>351</span>
declared that his six hundredth copy of ‘Thanatopsis’
was his best, and that George Sand was
heard to say with tears in her eyes that she wished
she had rewritten ‘Adam Bede’ just once more
and you have read that Tom Brown Hughes—”
</p>
<p>
“Go away with your nonsense! I told Dr. Towne
that you were my critic and that you knew every
thing.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you tell him every thing?” he asked, letting
the castle fall upon the carpet.
</p>
<p>
“That isn’t every thing.”
</p>
<p>
“Will you play a game with me?”
</p>
<p>
“No, thank you. I am too tired for any thing
so tiresome.”
</p>
<p>
“You are ungrateful. Did I not teach you to
play?”
</p>
<p>
“You did not teach me to play when I am tired.”
</p>
<p>
“You have promised to write to me, haven’t
you?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“No, I haven’t! If you only knew how many
I <em>have</em> promised; and Aunt Theresa has a basket
quilt cut out for me to make, sixty-four blocks!
How can you have the heart to suggest any thing
beside?”
</p>
<p>
“How many persons have you refused to write
to?”
</p>
<p>
“I just refused one.”
</p>
<p>
“Am I the only one you have refused?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no,” slipping the folded sheets into the envelope,
“there is Mr. Gesner and Dr. Greyson and
Professor Towne and—”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_352'></a>352</span>
</p>
<p>
“Dr. Towne?” His uneasy fingers scattered
several pawns over the black-and-green covering.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and Dr. Towne! And he was very good
about it, he only laughed.”
</p>
<p>
“Lady Blue, speak the truth.”
</p>
<p>
“About whom?”
</p>
<p>
“The latter. I am not concerned about the
others.”
</p>
<p>
“I told you the truth and you do not believe
me. Don’t you know that the truth is always funnier
than a fabrication?”
</p>
<p>
“If you ask me, perhaps I will come down and
stay over a Sunday with you.”
</p>
<p>
“Will you? Oh, I wish you would! I expect
to be homesick. Uncle Knox will be delighted to
have you to talk to.”
</p>
<p>
“I do not think that I shall travel fifty miles on
a cold night to talk to <em>him</em>.”
</p>
<p>
“Then I am sure that you will not to talk to
me.”
</p>
<p>
“You do not know what I would do for you.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I do. Any thing short of martyrdom.
Don’t you want to go in and see John Woodstock?
He is a pretty boy. There come father
and mother. You will excuse me if I do not make
my appearance again to-night; you know I have
been with Sue and I am so tired.”
</p>
<p>
“And you will not write to me?”
</p>
<p>
“What for? You may read Dine’s letters.”
</p>
<p>
“Tell me true, Tessa,” he answered catching both
her hands, “<em>did</em> you refuse to write to Dr. Towne?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_353'></a>353</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I did.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, may I ask?”
</p>
<p>
“For the same reason that I refuse to write to
you—no, that is not quite true—” she added, “but
it is because I don’t want to write to either of you.”
</p>
<p>
“Have all these years given me the right to ask
you a question?”
</p>
<p>
He still held both hands.
</p>
<p>
She answered seriously, “Yes. You are all the
big brother I have.”
</p>
<p>
“Then I will not ask it,” dropping her hands
and turning away.
</p>
<p>
“Say good-by, then.”
</p>
<p>
“Good-by.”
</p>
<p>
“I have not said any thing to displease you,
have I?”
</p>
<p>
“You will not write to me?”
</p>
<p>
“No, I can’t. I would if I could. I will tell
you—then you will understand and not care—somebody—”
</p>
<p>
“What right has somebody—”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Wadsworth entered laughing, Mr. Wadsworth
was close behind.
</p>
<p>
“Excuse me, sir; I can’t stay to play to-night.
Good night, Lady Blue. A pleasant visit and safe
return.”
</p>
<p>
An hour later Tessa was kneeling on the carpet
before her open trunk squeezing a roll of pencilled
manuscript into a corner.
</p>
<p>
A tap at the door was followed by a voice,
“Daughter, may I come in?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_354'></a>354</span>
</p>
<p>
“If you will not mind the confusion.”
</p>
<p>
He closed the door and seated himself on a chair
near the end of the trunk.
</p>
<p>
“There is a confusion somewhere that I <em>do</em>
mind,” he began nervously.
</p>
<p>
She looked up in surprise. “Why, father, is
there something that you don’t like? Don’t you
like it about Dine?”
</p>
<p>
“Daughter, if you are so blind that you will not
see, I must tell you. I like it well enough about
Dine, but I do not like it about <em>you</em>?”
</p>
<p>
Was it about Dr. Towne? How could he object
to him? For he could not be aware of <em>her</em> objection.
</p>
<p>
“I am afraid that you are teasing Gus rather too
much.”
</p>
<p>
“Teasing Gus! I never really teased him in my
life. We have never quarrelled even once.”
</p>
<p>
“I thought that women were quick about such
things, but you are as blind as a bat.”
</p>
<p>
“Such things?” She was making room for a
glove box, a pretty one of Russia leather that Gus
had given her. “He never cares for what I say!”
</p>
<p>
“How do you know that?”
</p>
<p>
“How do I know?” she repeated in perplexity,
making space in a corner while she considered her
reply. “Don’t <em>you</em> know why he can not be teased
by what I say and do?”
</p>
<p>
“I know this—he has asked me if he may marry
you some day.”
</p>
<p>
“<em>Me!</em> You mean Dine. You can’t mean me. I
know it is Dine.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_355'></a>355</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, child,” laughing heartily, “why should I
mean Dine? Why should it not be you?”
</p>
<p>
“It must be Dine,” she said positively. “Didn’t
he say Dine?”
</p>
<p>
“Am I in my dotage?”
</p>
<p>
“Couldn’t you misunderstand?”
</p>
<p>
“No, I could not. What is the matter with you,
to-night? You act as if you were bewildered.”
</p>
<p>
“So I am.”
</p>
<p>
“One evening, on the piazza, was it in May or
June? I was not well and I said so to him; and
he answered by telling me that he had always
thought of you, that he had grown up hoping to
marry you. Dine! Am I blind? Have I been
blind these ten years?”
</p>
<p>
“Didn’t he say any thing about Dine?”
</p>
<p>
“We spoke of her, of course. I would not tell
you, but I see how you are playing with him; he
will not intrude himself. O, Tessa, for a bright girl,
you are very stupid.”
</p>
<p>
“I am not bright; I am stupid.”
</p>
<p>
“This sisterly love is all very well, but a man
can not bear to have it carried too far. He is pure
gold, daughter; he is worthy of a princess. Now
don’t worry; you haven’t done any harm. Go to
bed and go to sleep; you have had too much worry
this last week.”
</p>
<p>
“I know it must be Dine.”
</p>
<p>
“If you did not look half sick, I would be
angry with you. I thought women were quick
witted.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_356'></a>356</span>
</p>
<p>
“I suppose some are,” she said slowly. “He will
never ask me, never.”
</p>
<p>
“Why not?” he asked sharply.
</p>
<p>
“Because—because—”
</p>
<p>
“Because you haven’t thought of it. If you do
not like any one—and I don’t see how you can—you
don’t, do you?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t—know.”
</p>
<p>
“There! There, dear, don’t cry! Go to sleep
and forget it.”
</p>
<p>
“I thought it was Dine. I have always thought
that it was Dine.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, good night. Don’t throw away the best
man in the world. I have known him ever since
he wore dresses, and he is worthy—even of you.
Put out your light and go to sleep. Don’t give
him a heartache.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I won’t, I won’t—if I can help it!”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t have any whims. There, child, don’t cry!
Kiss me and go to sleep.”
</p>
<p>
She did not cry; she was stunned and bewildered;
it was too dreadful to be true; even if she did love
Ralph Towne she would not love him if it would
make unhappy this friend and helper of all her life!
This new friend should not come between them to
make him miserable. Even if the old dream about
Ralph Towne <em>could</em> come true, she would not accept
his love at the cost of Gus Hammerton’s happiness.
Was he not her right arm? Was he not her right
eye? She had never missed him because he had
always lived in her life; he was as much a part of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_357'></a>357</span>
her home as her father and Dine; she would give
up any thing rather than hurt him. Had she not
suffered with him when she thought that he was
unhappy about Dine? She had loved him so much
that she had never thought of loving him; she had
been so proud that he had loved Dine. Was it his
influence that had kept her from loving Felix Harrison?
Was he the hindrance that was coming
between her and Dr. Towne? Was she troubled
because she could not honor and trust Dr. Towne
as she had unconsciously honored and trusted this
old, old friend? If the illusion about Ralph Towne
had never been dispelled, she would not have discovered
that Gus Hammerton was “pure gold” as
her father had said. They were both miserable to-night
because of her—and she had permitted one
of them to kiss her. Ralph Towne had left her
once to fight out her battle alone—he had not
been the shadow of a rock in her weary land—she
could think of this now away from the fascination
of his presence; but, present or absent, there
was no doubt, no reasoning about the old friend;
he had been tried, he was steadfast and true. True,
she had forgiven Ralph Towne; but her forgiveness
had not wrought any change in him. He was the
Ralph Towne of a year ago, with this difference
that now he loved her. Had his love for her
wrought any change in him? Was he not himself?
Would he not always be himself? Was she
satisfied with him if she could feel the need of
change?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_358'></a>358</span>
</p>
<p>
A year ago would she have reasoned thus?
Where love is, is there need of reasoning to prove
its existence, its depth or its power of continuance?
She knew that she loved God; she knew that she
loved her father. If she loved Ralph Towne, why
did she not know that, also?
</p>
<p>
Why must she reason? Why might she not
<em>know</em>? She did not know that she loved him. Did
she know that she did <em>not</em> love him? Wearied even
to exhaustion, her head drooped until it touched the
soft pile in the open trunk; there were no tears, not
a sound moved her lips; she was very glad that she
was going away.
</p>
<p>
If she might tell Gus, would he not talk it over
to her and make it plain? It would not be the
first matter in which he had taught her to discern
between the wrong and the right. Was there a
wrong and a right in this choosing?
</p>
<p>
The large tears gathered and fell.
</p>
<p>
Ralph Towne could not help her; he would say
caressingly, “Love me, and end the matter.” In
her extremity he was not a helper. Would he ever
be in any extremity of hers?
</p>
<p>
The tears fell for very weariness and bewilderment.
What beside was there to shed tears about?
She was so weary that she had forgotten.
</p>
<p>
A laugh in the hall below; the sound of a scuffle,
another laugh, and the closing of the street
door.
</p>
<p>
Those two children!
</p>
<p>
Dinah burst into the room, still laughing. “Why,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_359'></a>359</span>
Tessa! All through! You look as if you wanted
to pack yourself up, too,” she cried in a breezy voice.
“The candle is almost burnt down.”
</p>
<p>
“No matter. Don’t get another.”
</p>
<p>
“Your voice sounds as if you were sick. Mother
has been expecting you to be too sick to go.”
</p>
<p>
“I shall not be sick,” rising, and dropping the
lid of her trunk. “Tell me about the night you
overheard Gus talking to father on the piazza.”
</p>
<p>
“I did tell you, didn’t I? He did not mind because
John came tonight; didn’t you hear him
tease me? About that night? Oh, I was asleep,
and they were on the piazza; of course I don’t
know how long they had been talking, nor what
suggested it, but I heard him say,—really I’ve forgotten
just what, it was so long ago,—but father
said that he was so glad and happy about it, or it
meant that. I suppose I may have missed some
of it. Poor old Gus said that he knew I did not
care for any one else. Isn’t it touching? Poor
fellow! And I didn’t then. I never should if I
hadn’t gone away and found John. Lucky for me,
wasn’t it? Gus never looked at me as he did at
you tonight, anyway; I guess he’s transferring.”
</p>
<p>
Long after midnight Tessa fell asleep; her last
thought shaping itself thus:
</p>
<p>
“I can not reason myself into loving or not loving,
any more than I can reason the sun into shining
or not shining.”
</p>
<p>
On her way to the train the next morning, she
mailed a letter addressed—
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_360'></a>360</span>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>“Ralph&nbsp;&nbsp;Towne,&nbsp;&nbsp;M.&nbsp;&nbsp;D.,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;City.”</em><br />
</p>
<p>
Her tender, passionate, truth-loving, bewildered
heart had poured itself out in these words:
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
“I am so afraid of leading you to think something
that is not true; something that I may have
to contradict in the future. When I am with you,
I forget every thing but you; when I am alone, my
heart rises up and warns me that I may be making
another mistake, that I only <em>think</em> I love you because
I want to so much, and that I should only
worry you with my caprices and doubts if I should
marry you. You have been very patient with me,
but you might lose your patience if I should try it
too far. I <em>will</em> not marry you until I am <em>sure</em>; I
must know of a certainty that I love you with the
love that hopes, endures, that can suffer long and
still is kind. You do not know me, I am hard and
proud; when I went down into the Valley of Humiliation
because of believing that you loved me when
you did not, I was not gentle and sweet and forgiving—I
was hard and bitter; I hated you almost
as much as I had loved you. Now I must think it
all through and live through all those days, the
days when I loved you and the days when I hated
you, before I can understand myself. I could marry
you and we could live a life of surface peace and
satisfaction, and you might be satisfied in me and
with me; but if <em>I</em> felt the need of loving you more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_361'></a>361</span>
than I did love you, my life would be bondage. If
the pride and hardness and unforgivingness may
be taken away and I <em>may</em> love you and believe in
you as I did that day that you brought me the
English violets, I shall be as happy—no, a thousand
times happier than I was then. But you must
not hope for that; it is not <em>natural</em>; it may be that
of grace such changes are wrought, but grace is
long in working in proud hearts. You are not
bound to me by any word that you have spoken;
find some one gentle and loving who will love you
for what you are and for what you will be.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_362'></a>362</span><a name='ch23' id='ch23'></a>XXIII.—WHAT SHE MEANT.</h2>
<p>
In the weeks that followed, Tessa learned to the
full the meaning of <em>homesickness</em>. No kindness could
have exceeded the kindness that she hourly received
from uncle and aunt and from the inmates of the
cottage over the way; still every night, or rather
early every morning, she fell asleep with tears upon
her cheeks; she longed for her father, her mother,
for Dine and Gus, for Miss Jewett, for Nan Gerard,
and even poor, grief-stricken Sue; for Mrs. Towne’s
dear face and dear hands she longed inexpressibly,
and she longed with a longing to which she would
give no sympathy for another presence, an unobtrusive
presence that would not push its way, a
presence with the aroma of humility, gentleness,
and a shy love that persisted with a persistence
that neither the darkness of night nor the light of
day could dispel.
</p>
<p>
Lying alone in the darkness in the strange, low
room, with a fading glow upon the hearth that
lent an air of unreality to the old-fashioned furniture,
she congratulated herself upon having been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_363'></a>363</span>
brave and true, of having withheld from her lips a
draught for which she had so long and so despairingly
thirsted; she had been so brave and true that
she must needs be strong, wherefore then was she
so weak? Sometimes for hours she would lie in perfect
quiet thinking of Mr. Hammerton; but thinking
of him as calmly as she thought about her father.
There was no intensity in her love for him, no
thrill, save that of gratitude for his years of brotherly
watchfulness; she would have been proud of
him had he married Dine; his friendship was a distinction
that she had worn for years as her rarest
ornament; he was her intellect, as her father was
her conscience, but to give up all the others for
him, to love him above father, mother, sister—to
give up forever the hope of loving Ralph Towne
some day—she shuddered and covered her face
with her hands there alone in the dark. Cheery
enough she was through the days, sewing for Aunt
Theresa and falling into her happiest talk of books
and people, thoughts and things, reading aloud to
Uncle Knox, and every evening reading aloud the
pages of manuscript that she had written that day,
and every afternoon, laying aside work or writing,
to run across to the cottage for a couple of hours
with Miss Sarepta.
</p>
<p>
Miss Sarepta at her window in her wheelchair
watched all day the black, brown, or blue figure at
her writing or sewing, and when the hour came,
saw the pencils dropped into the box, the leaves
of manuscript gathered, the figure rise and toss
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_364'></a>364</span>
out its arms with a weary motion; then, in a few
moments the figure with a bright shawl over its
head would run down the path, stand a moment
at the gate to look up and down and all around,
and then, with the air of a child out of school, run
across the street and sometimes around the garden
before she brought her bright face into the
watcher’s cosy, little world.
</p>
<p>
Miss Sarepta’s mother described Tessa as “bright,
wide awake, and ready for the next thing.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Sarepta told Tessa that while knowing that
good things were laid up for her, she had no thought
that such a good thing as Tessa Wadsworth was
laid up for this winter’s enjoyment and employment.
</p>
<p>
It may be that the strain of the day’s living
added to the feverishness of the night’s yearnings;
for when darkness fell and the wind sounded
in the sitting-room chimney, her heart sank, her
hands grew cold, her throat ached with repressed
tears, and when she could no longer bear it, the
daily paper having been read aloud and a letter or
two written, she would take her candle and bid the
old people as cheery a good night as her lips could
utter and hasten up-stairs to her fire on the hearth
to reperuse her letters and to dream waking dreams
of what might be, and when the fire burned low to
lie awake in the darkness, till, spent in flesh and in
spirit, she would fall asleep.
</p>
<p>
At the beginning of the third week, she took
herself to hand; with a figurative and merciless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_365'></a>365</span>
gripe upon each shoulder she thus addressed herself:
“Now, Tessa Wadsworth, you and I have
had enough of this; we have had enough of freaks
and whims for one lifetime; you are to behave
and go to sleep.”
</p>
<p>
Behaving and going to sleep took until midnight
with the first attempt, and she dreamed of
Dr. Lake and awoke crying. Was Sue crying, too?
Sue had loved her husband, his influence would
color all her life, she might yet become her ideal
of a woman; <em>womanly</em>. Sue’s hand had been in
his life; had not his hand with a firmer grasp tightened
around her life?
</p>
<p>
Tessa did not forget to be metaphysical even at
midnight with the tears of a dream on her eyelashes.
</p>
<p>
Was every one she loved asleep, or had some one
dreamed of her and awoke to think of her?
</p>
<p>
“God bless every one I love,” she murmured,
“and every one who loves me.”
</p>
<p>
The next night by sheer force of will she was
asleep before the clock struck eleven, and did not
dream of home or once awake until Hilda, the
Swedish servant, passed her door at dawn.
</p>
<p>
Her letters through this time were radiant, of
course. Mrs. Towne only, with her perfect understanding
of Tessa, detected the homesickness, or
heartsickness. Tessa was wading in deep waters;
she did not need her, else she would have come to
her. She had learned that it was her characteristic
to fight out her battles alone.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_366'></a>366</span>
</p>
<p>
Had Ralph any thing to do with this? He had
suddenly grown graver, not more silent; in the
morning his eyes would have a sleepless look, the
sunshine seemed utterly gone from them; once he
said, apropos of nothing, after a long fit of abstraction:
“It is right for a man to pay for being a
fool and a knave, but it comes terribly hard.”
</p>
<p>
“I suppose it must,” she had replied, “until he
learns how God forgives.”
</p>
<p>
In her next letter to Tessa, Mrs. Towne had written,
“Do you know how God forgives?” and Tessa
had replied, “You and I seem to be thinking the
same thought nowadays, and nowanights, for last
night it came to me that loving <em>enough</em> to forgive
is the love that makes Him so happy.”
</p>
<p>
This letter was the only one of all written that
winter that Mrs. Towne showed to her son. It was
not returned to her. Months afterward he showed
it to Tessa, saying that that thought was more to
him than all the sermons to which he had ever listened.
“Because you didn’t know how to listen,”
she answered saucily, adding in a reverent tone, “I
did not understand it until I <em>lived</em> it.”
</p>
<p>
The letter had been written with burning cheeks;
if he might read it, she would be glad; it would reveal
something that she did not dare tell him herself;
but she had no hope that he would see it.
</p>
<p>
“Tessa is not so bright as she was,” observed
Miss Sarepta’s mother, “she’s more settled down;
I guess that she has found out what she means; it
takes a deal of time for young women to do that.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_367'></a>367</span><a name='ch24' id='ch24'></a>XXIV.—SHUT IN.</h2>
<p>
It was a trial to Sarepta Towne that the sun did
not rise and set in the west, for in that case her
bay window would have been perfect.
</p>
<p>
Dinah had named this window “summer time:”
on each side ivy was climbing in profusion; on the
right side stood a fuchsia six feet in height; opposite
this an oleander was bursting into bloom; a
rose geranium and a pot of sweet clover were
placed on brackets and were Tessa’s special favorites;
one hanging basket from which trailed Wandering
Jew was filled with oxalis in bloom, another
was but a mass of graceful and shining greens.
</p>
<p>
In the centre of the window on a low table stood
a Ward’s case; into this Dinah had never grown tired
of looking; Professor Towne had constructed it on
his last visit at home, and one of the pleasures
of it to Miss Sarepta had consisted in the talks
they had while planning it together. Among its
ferns, mosses, berries, and trailing arbutus they had
formed a grotto of shells and bits of rocks; the floor
was bits of looking-glass; tufts of eye-bright were
mingled with the mosses and were now in bloom,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_368'></a>368</span>
and Miss Sarepta was sure that the trailing arbutus
would flower before Tessa could bring it home to
her from the woods.
</p>
<p>
“This room is full of Philip and Cousin Ralph,”
Sarepta had said; “his picture is but one of the
things in it and in this house to remind me of
Cousin Ralph.”
</p>
<p>
“Sarepta breathes Philip,” her mother replied.
</p>
<p>
“We are twin spirits like Blaise and Jacqueline
Pascal. Do you know about them, Tessa?”
</p>
<p>
“I know that he was a monk and she a nun.”
</p>
<p>
“That is like me, and not like Philip,” said Miss
Sarepta; “he shall not be a monk because I am
a nun!”
</p>
<p>
“His wife will be jealous enough of you, though,”
said Mrs. Towne; “not a mail comes that he does not
send you something. How would she like that?”
</p>
<p>
“Philip could not love any one that would come
between us. Tessa, do you admire my brother as
much as I wish you to do?”
</p>
<p>
“I admire him exceedingly,” said Tessa, looking
up from her twenty-fifth block of the basket quilt;
“he is my ideal. I knew that I had found my ideal
as soon as I saw him; I did not wait to hear him
speak.”
</p>
<p>
And that he was her ideal she became more and
more assured, for in February he spent a week at
home and she had opportunity to study him at all
hours and in any hour of the day. He had lost his
fancied resemblance to Dr. Towne, or <em>she</em> had lost
it in thinking of him as only himself. The long
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_369'></a>369</span>
talks, during which she sat, at Miss Sarepta’s side,
on a foot cushion, work in hand, the basket blocks,
or some more fanciful work for Miss Sarepta, she
remembered afterward as one of the times in her
life in which she <em>grew</em>. She told Miss Sarepta that
she and her brother were like the men and women
that St. Paul in his Epistles sent his love to. “He
ought to marry a saint like Madame Guyon; I think
that it would be easier to revere him as a saint than
to marry him. I can’t imagine any woman forgiving
him, or loving him because he <em>needs</em> her love;
he stands so far above me, I could never think of
him as at my side and sometimes saying, ‘Help me,
Tessa,’ or, ‘What do <em>you</em> think?’”
</p>
<p>
“Now we know your ideal of marriage,” laughed
Mrs. Towne. “Philip is a good boy, but he sometimes
needs looking after.”
</p>
<p>
“Stockings and shirt buttons!”
</p>
<p>
“And other things, too. He is forgetful, and
he’s rather careless. How much he is taken up
with that reading class!”
</p>
<p>
“In a monkish way,” smiled Miss Sarepta. “He
was full of enthusiasm about Ralph, too, mother.”
</p>
<p>
“How is it, Miss Tessa, do you admire Dr. Towne
as much as you do St. Philip?” inquired the old
lady with good-humored sarcasm.
</p>
<p>
“He is not a saint,” said Tessa, “he needs looking
after in several matters besides stockings and
shirt buttons.”
</p>
<p>
“Philip talks about him! What is it that he
says he is, Sarepta?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_370'></a>370</span>
</p>
<p>
“In his profession just what he expected that
he would be,—quick, quiet, gentle, sympathetic,
patient, persevering; he has thrown himself into
it heart and soul. Philip used to wonder if he
would ever find his vocation; his life always had
a promise of good things—”
</p>
<p>
“But he was slow about it; not quick like Philip;
he should have begun practice ten years ago. What
has he been doing all this time?”
</p>
<p>
“We can see the fruit of his doing, mother; it
does not much matter as to the doing itself. Don’t
you know that six years are given to the perfecting
even of a beetle?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know about beetles and things; I know
that I used to think that my boy would outstrip
Lydia’s boy.”
</p>
<p>
“Mother! mother!” laughed Sarepta, “you mind
earthly things. I shall never run a race with anybody.
Can’t you be a little proud of me?”
</p>
<p>
Sarepta Towne had her brother’s eyes, but her
hair was brighter, with not one silver thread among
its short curls; her fair, fresh face was certainly ten
years younger than his. In summer her wrappers
were of white; in winter she kept herself a bird in
gay plumage; always the singing-bird, in white or
crimson. When Philip Towne said “My sister,”
his voice and eyes said “My saint.”
</p>
<p>
Once, after a silence, Tessa asked about her
“Shut-ins.” “How did it come into your heart
at first?”
</p>
<p>
“It is a long story; first tell me what your heart
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_371'></a>371</span>
has been about. It has been painting your eyes
darker and darker.”
</p>
<p>
“It is a very foolish heart then; it was only repeating
something that I learned once and did not
then understand. I do not know that I can say it
correctly, but it is like this:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘God’s&nbsp;&nbsp;generous&nbsp;&nbsp;in&nbsp;&nbsp;giving,&nbsp;&nbsp;say&nbsp;&nbsp;I,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;thing&nbsp;&nbsp;which&nbsp;&nbsp;he&nbsp;&nbsp;gives,&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;deny<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&nbsp;&nbsp;He&nbsp;&nbsp;ever&nbsp;&nbsp;can&nbsp;&nbsp;take&nbsp;&nbsp;back&nbsp;&nbsp;again.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&nbsp;&nbsp;gives&nbsp;&nbsp;what&nbsp;&nbsp;He&nbsp;&nbsp;gives:&nbsp;&nbsp;be&nbsp;&nbsp;content.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&nbsp;&nbsp;resumes&nbsp;&nbsp;nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;given;&nbsp;&nbsp;be&nbsp;&nbsp;sure.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God&nbsp;&nbsp;lend?&nbsp;&nbsp;where&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;usurers&nbsp;&nbsp;lent<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In&nbsp;&nbsp;His&nbsp;&nbsp;temple,&nbsp;&nbsp;indignant&nbsp;&nbsp;He&nbsp;&nbsp;went<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And&nbsp;&nbsp;scourged&nbsp;&nbsp;away&nbsp;&nbsp;all&nbsp;&nbsp;those&nbsp;&nbsp;impure.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&nbsp;&nbsp;lends&nbsp;&nbsp;not,&nbsp;&nbsp;but&nbsp;&nbsp;gives&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;end,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As&nbsp;&nbsp;He&nbsp;&nbsp;loves&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;end.&nbsp;&nbsp;If&nbsp;&nbsp;it&nbsp;&nbsp;seem<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&nbsp;&nbsp;He&nbsp;&nbsp;draws&nbsp;&nbsp;back&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;gift,&nbsp;&nbsp;comprehend<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’Tis&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;add&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;it&nbsp;&nbsp;rather,&nbsp;&nbsp;amend<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And&nbsp;&nbsp;finish&nbsp;&nbsp;it&nbsp;&nbsp;up&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;your&nbsp;&nbsp;dream.’”<br />
</p>
<p>
“Well?” said Miss Sarepta.
</p>
<p>
“Once,—a long time ago, it seems now,—He
gave me something; it was love for somebody;
and then He took it—or I let it go, because it was
too much trouble to keep it; I did not like His gift,
it hurt too much; I was glad to let it go, and yet I
missed it so; I was not worthy such a perfect gift
as a love that could be hurt in loving; I could love
as I loved all beauty and goodness and truth, but
when I found that love must hold on and endure,
must hope and believe, must suffer shame and loss,
I gave it up. God was generous in giving; He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_372'></a>372</span>
gave me all I could receive, and when He would
have given me more, I shrank away from His giving
and said, ‘It hurts too much. I am too proud
to take love or give love if I must be made humble
first. I wanted to give like a queen, not stooping
from my full height, and I wanted to give to a
king: instead, I was asked to give—just like any
common mortal to another common mortal, and
that after we had misinterpreted and misunderstood
each other, and I had written hard things
of him all over my heart, and what he had thought
me, nobody knows but himself! And now I think,
if I will, that I may have the love again finished
up to my dream; finished above any thing that I
knew how to ask or think, and it is altogether too
good and perfect a gift for me; so good that I can
not keep it, I must needs give it away.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa had told her story with quickened breath,
not once lifting the eyes that were growing darker
and darker.
</p>
<p>
Miss Sarepta’s “thank you” held all the appreciation
that Tessa wished.
</p>
<p>
“And now,” after another silence, for these two
loved silences together, “you want to know about
my dear Shut-ins. Philip named them from the
words, ‘And the Lord shut him in.’ It began one
day when I was sitting alone thinking! I am often
sitting alone thinking; but this day I was thinking
sad thoughts about my useless, idle life, and I had
planned my life to be such a busy life. There was
nothing that I could do to help along; I had to sit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_373'></a>373</span>
still and be helped; and I shouldn’t wonder if I cried
a little. That was five years ago, we were living
in the city then; in the middle of my bemoanings
and my tears, I spied the postman crossing the
street. How Philip laughed when I told him that
I loved that postman better than any man in all
the world! That day he brought me several lovely
things: one of them a book from Cousin Ralph, and
a letter from Aunt Lydia; that letter is the beginning
of my story. She told me about a little invalid
that she had found and suggested that I should
write one of my charming letters to her. Of course
you know that I write charming letters! So I wiped
away my naughty tears and wrote the charming letter!
In a few days, my hero, the postman, brought
the reply. That was my first Shut-in letter. Bring
me the album, I will show you Susie.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa brought it and Miss Sarepta opened it on
her lap to an intelligent, serious, sweet face.
</p>
<p>
“She has not taken a step for many years; she
is among the youngest of many children; her great
love is love for children, she teaches daily thirteen
little ones. The one thing in her life that strikes
me is her <em>faithfulness</em>. There is nothing too little
for her to be faithful in. One of her great longings
used to be for letters; oh, if the postman
would only bring her a letter! For a year or two
I wrote every week, the longest, brightest, most
every-day letters I could think of. And one day
it came to me that if <em>we</em> had such a good time together,
why should we not find some other to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_374'></a>374</span>
whom a letter or a book would be as a breath of
fresh air. I pondered the matter for a month or
two, but I couldn’t advertise for an invalid, and
none of my friends knew of any. One morning I
glanced through a religious paper, and tossed it
aside, then something moved me to pick it up
again, and there she was! The one I sought!
That was Elsie. Look at her pale, patient face.
For fourteen years she has lived in one room.
And hasn’t she the brightest, most grateful, happiest
heart that ever beat in a frail body or a strong
one? Her poems are graceful little things; I will
show you some of them. She had been praying six
months for a helpful friend, when she received my
first letter. Her letters are gems. You shall read
a pile of them. And she had a Shut-in friend, to
whom I must write, of course. She is Mabel. I
have no picture of her. When she was well, they
called her the laughing girl; she has lain eleven
years in bed!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me!” sighed Tessa.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t sigh, child. She writes in pencil as she
can not lift her head. I call her my sunbeam.
She often dates her letters ‘In my Corner.’ So another
year went on with my three Shut-ins. I forgot
to cry about my folded hands and useless life.
One day it came into my mind to write a sketch
and call it, ‘Our Shut-in Society’; to write all about
Mabel and Elsie and Sue, and send it to the paper
in which I had found Elsie’s first article.
</p>
<p>
“And that sketch! How it was read! I received letters
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_375'></a>375</span>
from north, south, east, and west concerning
it. Was there really such a society, and
were there such happy people as Mabel, Elsie, and
Susie? One who had not spoken aloud for fourteen
years would love to write to them; another
who had locked her school-room door one summer
day, and come home to rest, had been forced to rest
through eight long years, and was so lonely, with
her sisters married and away; another, quite an old
man, who had lain for six years in the loft of an
old log-cabin, was eager for a word or a paper.
How his letter touched us all! ‘The others have
letters, but when the mail comes naught comes to
me,’ he wrote. But you will be tired of hearing
my long story; you shall see their letters; you must
see Delle’s letters; she sits all day in a wheelchair,
and has no hope of ever taking a step; she has a
mother and a little boy; the brightest little boy!
Her poems have appeared in some of our best periodicals;
we are something beside a band of sufferers,
Miss Tessa; some of us are literary! My
most precious letters are from Elizabeth; her fiftieth
birthday came not long since; for ten years
her home has been in one room; she has written a
book that the Shut-ins cry over.
</p>
<p>
“And oh, we have a prisoner! A Shut-in shut
up in state’s prison. A young man with an innocent,
boyish face; he ran away from home when he
was a child and ran into state’s prison because no
one cared what became of him. His letters are
unaffected and grateful; he does want to be a good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_376'></a>376</span>
boy! Thirty-six are on my list now; I would find
more if I had strength to write more; some of them
have more and some less than I; many of them
have Shut-ins that I know nothing about. We
remember each other on holidays and birthdays!
The things that postmen and country mail-carriers
have in their mail-bags are funny to see: flower
seeds, bits of fancy work, photographs, pictures,
any thing and every thing!
</p>
<p>
“They all look forward to mail-time through the
night and through the day.
</p>
<p>
“And, speaking humanly, my share in it, all I
receive and the little I give, came out of my self-bemoanings
and tears; my longing to be a helper
in some small way!
</p>
<p>
“Now if you want to help me, you may cut some
blocks of patch-work for me. One of the Shut-ins
is making a quilt to leave as a memorial to her
daughter, and I want to send my contribution
to the mail to-night; and you may direct several
papers for me, and cover that book, ‘Thoughts for
Weary Hours.’ I press you into my service, you
see.”
</p>
<p>
“Miss Sarepta, I am ashamed.”
</p>
<p>
“Shame is an evidence of something; go on.”
</p>
<p>
“I am ashamed that I am such a dreamer.”
</p>
<p>
“Philip says that you are a dreamer.”
</p>
<p>
“I care for my writing.”
</p>
<p>
“Mowers work while they whet their scythes,”
quoted Miss Sarepta.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_377'></a>377</span><a name='ch25' id='ch25'></a>XXV.—BLUE MYRTLE.</h2>
<p>
In March, Tessa found myrtle in bloom, and took
a handful of the blue blossoms mingled with sprays
of the green leaves to Miss Sarepta.
</p>
<p>
“Spring has come,” she said dropping them on
the open book in Miss Sarepta’s lap.
</p>
<p>
“If spring has come, then I must lose you.”
</p>
<p>
“Every hand that I know in Dunellen is beckoning
me homewards; my winter’s work is done.”
</p>
<p>
That evening—it was the sixth of March, that
date ever afterward was associated with blue myrtle
and Nan Gerard—she was sitting at the table
writing letters; in the same chair and at the same
place at the table where Dinah had written her
letter about Gus and her wonderful John; Aunt
Theresa was knitting this evening also, and Uncle
Knox was asleep in a chintz-covered wooden rocker
with the big cat asleep on his knees.
</p>
<p>
She had written a letter to Mabel and one to
Elsie, lively descriptive letters, making a picture of
Miss Sarepta’s book-lined, picture-decorated, flower-scented
room and a picture of Miss Sarepta, also
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_378'></a>378</span>
touching lightly upon her own breezy out-of-door
life with its hard work and its beautiful hopes.
The third letter was a sheet to Mrs. Towne; the
sentence in ending was one that Mrs. Towne had
been eagerly and anxiously expecting all through
the winter: “My ring reminds me of my promise;
a promise that I shall keep some day, perhaps.”
</p>
<p>
“Tessa, are you unhappy, child?” asked Aunt
Theresa with a knitting needle between her lips.
</p>
<p>
“Unhappy! Why, auntie, what am I doing?”
</p>
<p>
The tall lamp with its white china shade stood
between them. Aunt Theresa took the knitting
needle from its place of safety and counted fourteen
stitches before she replied.
</p>
<p>
“Sighing! When young people sigh, something
must ail them. What do <em>you</em> have to be miserable
about?”
</p>
<p>
“I am not miserable.”
</p>
<p>
“Tell me, what are you miserable about?”
</p>
<p>
“Sometimes—I am not satisfied—that is all.”
</p>
<p>
“I should think that that was enough. What
are you dissatisfied about? Haven’t you enough
to eat and to drink and clothes enough to wear?
Haven’t you a good father and mother who wouldn’t
see you want for any thing? What is it that you
haven’t enough of, pray?”
</p>
<p>
“I do not know that I am wishing for any thing—to night.
I am learning to wait.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, you are! You are wishing for something
that isn’t in this world, I know.”
</p>
<p>
“Then I’ll find it in heaven.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_379'></a>379</span>
</p>
<p>
“People don’t sigh after heaven as a usual thing.
You read too many books, that’s what’s the matter
with you. Reading too many books affects different
people in different ways; I’ve seen a good deal
of girls’ reading.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa’s pen was scribbling initials on a half sheet
of paper.
</p>
<p>
“I know the symptoms. Some girls when they
read love-stories become dissatisfied with their
looks; they look into the glass and worry over
their freckles or their dark skins, or their big
mouths or turn-up noses; they fuss over their
waists and try to squeeze them slim and slender,
and they cripple themselves squeezing their number
four feet into number two shoes. But you are
not that kind. And some girls despise their fathers
and mothers because they can’t speak grammar
and pronounce long words, and because they
say ‘care’ for carry and ‘empt’ for empty! And
they despise their homes and their plain, substantial
furniture. But you are not that kind
either. Your face is well enough, and your father
and mother are well enough, and your home
is well enough.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa was scribbling Dunellen, then she wrote
R. T. and Nan Gerard.
</p>
<p>
“And you are not sighing for a lordly lover,”
continued Aunt Theresa, with increasing energy
“You don’t want him to wear a cloak or carry a
sword. Your trouble is different! You read a
higher grade of love-stories, about men that are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_380'></a>380</span>
honorable and true, who would die before they
would tell a lie or say any thing that isn’t so.
They are as gentle as zephyrs; they would walk
over eggs and not crack them; they are always
thinking of something new and startling and deep
that it can’t enter a woman’s mind to conceive, and
their faces have different expressions enough in
one minute to wear one ordinary set of muscles
out; and they never think of themselves, they
would burn up and not know it, because they
were keeping a fly off of somebody else; they are
so high and mighty and simple and noble that an
angel might take pattern by them. And that is
what troubles you. You read about such fine fellows
and shut the book and step out into life and
break your heart because the real, mannish man,
who is usually as good as human nature and all
the grace he has got will help him be, isn’t so perfect
and noble as this perfect man that somebody
has made out of his head. You can’t be satisfied
with a real human man who thinks about himself
and does wrong when it is too hard to do right,
even if he comes on his bended knees and says he’s
sorry and that he’ll never do such a thing again.
You want to love somebody that you are proud of;
you are too proud to love somebody that is as weak
as you are. And so you can’t be satisfied at all!
Why <em>must</em> you be satisfied?”
</p>
<p>
“Why should I not be?”
</p>
<p>
“For the best reason in the world; to be satisfied
in any man, in his love for you and in your love for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_381'></a>381</span>
him, would be—do you know what it would be?
It would be idolatry.”
</p>
<p>
Aunt Theresa’s attention was given to her knitting;
she did not see the shining of Tessa’s eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Be satisfied with God, child, and take all the
happiness you can get.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa’s pen was making tremulous capitals.
</p>
<p>
“Be satisfied <em>with</em>, if you can, but not <em>in</em>, some
good man who stumbles to-day and stands straight
to-morrow; I fought it out on that line once, and so
I know all about it.”
</p>
<p>
This then was the experience that Dr. Towne
had said that she must ask for; had he guessed
that it would be altogether on his side?
</p>
<p>
This was it, and this was all. Uncle Knox’s old
eyes had a look for his old wife that they never
held for any other living thing, and as for Aunt
Theresa, how often had Tessa thought, “I want to
grow old and love somebody the way you do.”
</p>
<p>
<em>Might</em> she be satisfied with God and love Ralph
Towne all she wanted to?
</p>
<p>
“Why, Theresa,” exclaimed Uncle Knox, opening
his eyes and staring at his wife, “I haven’t
heard you talk so much sentiment for thirty years.”
</p>
<p>
“And you will not in another thirty years. But
Tessa was in a tangle—I know eggs when I see the
shells—and I had to help her out.”
</p>
<p>
A tap at the window brought Tessa to her feet.
A neighbor had brought the mail; she took the
papers and letters with a most cordial “thank you”
and came to the table with both hands full. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_382'></a>382</span>
papers she opened and glanced through; the letters
she took up-stairs to read. The business-looking
envelope she opened first; she read it once, twice,
then gave an exclamation of delight. Oh, how
pleased her father would be! Her manuscript
had given such perfect satisfaction that, although
written for pictures, the pictures would be discarded
and new ones made to illustrate her story.
Gus would congratulate her, and Miss Jewett; this
appreciation by the publisher was the crown that
the winter’s work would always wear for her. With
a long breath, she sighed, “Oh, what a blessed winter
this has been to me!”
</p>
<p>
The long, white envelope was from Mrs. Towne,
the chocolate from Sue, the cream-colored from Dinah,
the pale blue from Miss Jewett, the pink from
Nan Gerard, and the square white from Laura Harrison.
Mr. Hammerton had not once written; a
kind message through her father or Dinah was
all evidence he had given of remembrance. Mrs.
Towne’s letter was opened before the others. What
would Dine or Miss Jewett or Laura think of this?
The faint perfume was the lady herself, so real was
her presence that Tessa felt her arms about her as
she read.
</p>
<p>
“Sue does not come to me as often as in the winter,”
she wrote; “the Gesners, one and all, are proving
themselves more alluring. Miss Gesner will
be a good friend to her. If you could hear her
laugh and talk, you would think of her as Sue
Greyson and never as the widowed Mrs. Lake.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_383'></a>383</span>
She is Dr. Lake’s widow, certainly she is not his
wife. Ralph growls about it in his kind way, but
I think that he did not expect any thing deeper
from her. Nan Gerard was with me all day yesterday;
she was as sweet and shy as a wild flower.
Nan’s heart is awake. Am I a silly old woman?
I dream of you every night. I would be a washer-woman
and live in Gesner’s Row, if I might have
you for my daughter, never to leave me. Now I
<em>am</em> a silly old woman and I will go to bed.”
</p>
<p>
The perfumed sheet was passed to the reader’s
lips before the next envelope was torn open.
</p>
<p>
Dinah’s letter was a sheet of foolscap; it was
written as a diary.
</p>
<p>
The first entry was merely an account of attending
a concert with John; the second stated in a few
strong words the failure of a bank. Old Mr. Hammerton
had lost a large amount of money and had
had a stroke of paralysis.
</p>
<p>
The third contained the history of a call from Sue;
how tall and elegant she looked in her rich mourning,
and how she had talked about her courtship
and marriage all the time.
</p>
<p>
The fourth day their father had had an attack of
pain, but it had not lasted as long as usual.
</p>
<p>
The last page was filled in Dine’s eager, story-telling
style:
</p>
<p>
“Just to think, Tessa, now I know the end of
my romance. It was dark last night just before
tea, and I went into the front hall for something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_384'></a>384</span>
that I wanted to get out of the hat-stand drawer.
The sitting-room door stood slightly ajar; I did not
know that Gus was with father until I heard his
voice. I did not listen, truly I did not; after I
heard the first sentence I didn’t dare stir for fear
of making my presence known. I moved off as
easily and swiftly as I could, but I heard every
word as plainly as if I had been in the room. It
is queer that I should overhear the beginning and
the ending of poor Gus’s only romance, isn’t it?
I heard him say, ‘Every thing is changed in my
plans; father is left with nothing but his good
name, my mother is aged and feeble, my sister is
a widow with a child; <em>her</em> money is gone, too. I
am the sole support of four people. I could not
marry, even if I desired to do so. And since I
have definitely learned that she does not think of
me, and never has thought of me, and that she
thinks of some one else, the bachelor’s life will be
no great hardship.’
</p>
<p>
“I had got to the parlor door by that time, so,
of course, I never can know father’s answer. But
isn’t it dreadful? I suppose that he is over the disappointment,
for his voice sounded as cool as usual;
too cold, I thought. I should have liked him better
if he had been in a flutter. I shall never tell
any body but John. Poor old, wise old, dear old
Gus! He will pursue the even tenor of his unmarried way,
and no one will ever guess that he has
had a romance. Perhaps Felix Harrison has had
one, too. Perhaps every body has.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_385'></a>385</span>
</p>
<p>
So it <em>was</em> Dinah, after all. And she had fought
her long, hard fights all for nothing.
</p>
<p>
It <em>was</em> Dine, and now her father would understand;
he would not think her blind and stupid; he
would not be disappointed that she had not chosen
his choice!
</p>
<p>
And that it was herself that Gus Hammerton
had loved, the wife of John Woodstock always
believed. And that it was herself, Tessa never
knew; for not knowing that he had stood at the
window that night that Dr. Towne had brought
her home, and witnessed their parting at the gate,
how could she divine that “definitely learned that
she does not think of me,” had referred to her?
</p>
<p>
Mr. Wadsworth had listened in utter bewilderment,
recalling Tessa’s repeated declaration that it
was Dinah. “I <em>am</em> in my dotage,” he thought;
“for I certainly understood that he said Tessa.”
</p>
<p>
“My wish was with your wish,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“She will be better satisfied,” Mr. Hammerton
answered in his most abrupt tone. “He is
a fine man; I can understand his attraction for
her.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Wadsworth entered at that instant and the
conversation was too fraught with pain to both
ever to be resumed; therefore it fell out that Mr.
Hammerton was the only one in the world who
ever knew, beyond a perhaps, which of the sisters
he had asked of the father.
</p>
<p>
That Tessa had not been influenced by his importunate
and mistaken urging, was one of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_386'></a>386</span>
things that her father was thankful for to the end
of his days.
</p>
<p>
“Poor Gus! The dear, brave boy,” sighed Tessa
over her letter. “And my worry has only been to
reveal to me that I can not reason myself into loving
or not loving.”
</p>
<p>
A paragraph in Nan Gerard’s letter was dwelt
long upon; then the daintily written pink sheet
dropped from her fingers and she sat bending forward
looking into the glowing brands until the
lights were out down-stairs and Hilda’s heavy
step had passed her door.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Naughty Nan!” she said rousing herself, “I
hope that you love him very, very much. Better
than I know how to do!”
</p>
<p>
The paragraph ran in this fashion:
</p>
<p>
“I have had a very pretty present; I really believe
that I like it better than any thing that Robert
ever gave me. It is a ring with an onyx: on
the stone is engraved two letters in monogram.
You shall guess them, my counsellor, and it will
not be hard when I whisper that one of them is T.
I am very happy and very good. ‘Nan’s Experiment’
is burnt up and with it all my foolishness.
‘Such as I wish it to be.’ I think of that whenever
I look at my ring. Tell me all about your lovely
Miss Sarepta. I like to know how I shall have
to behave before her. We are to be married next
month.”
</p>
<p>
Did Nan know the hurt and the hurt and the
hurt of love? No wonder that she was “shy” with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_387'></a>387</span>
Mrs. Towne. Why had not Mrs. Towne told her?
Must she write and congratulate Naughty Nan
whose story was such as she wished it to be?
</p>
<p>
The letters that she had written that evening
were on the bureau; the sudden remembering of
the line that she had written in Mrs. Towne’s
brought her to her feet with a rush of shame
like the old hot flashes from head to foot; she
seized the letter and rolling it up tucked it down
among the coals; it blazed, burning slowly, the
flame curled around the words that she had been
saved just in time from sending; the words that
would never be written or spoken.
</p>
<p>
The room was chilly and the candle had burnt
out before she went to bed; the lights opposite had
long been out. The room was cold and dark and
strange; outside in the darkness the night was wild.
</p>
<p>
It was too late; her conflict had lasted too long;
her pride and disdain had killed his love for her;
perhaps he felt as she did in that time when she
had wanted some one to love her, and he had taken
Naughty Nan as she had taken Felix.
</p>
<p>
She had lived it all through once; she could
live it all through again; she could have slept, but
would not for fear of the waking. Oh, if it would
never come light, and she could lie forever shielded
in darkness! But the light crept up higher and
higher into the sky, Hilda passed the door, and
Uncle Knox’s heavy tread was in the hall below.
</p>
<p>
Another day had come, and other days would
always be coming; every day life must be full of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_388'></a>388</span>
work and play, even although Dr. Towne had
failed in love that was patience; she had suffered
once, because he was slow to understand himself,
and plainly he had suffered to the verge of his
endurance, because she was slow in understanding
herself!
</p>
<p>
The day wore on to twilight; she had worked
listlessly; in the twilight she laid her work aside,
and went over to the cottage.
</p>
<p>
“I have something to show you,” said Miss Sarepta;
“guess what my last good gift from Philip
is.”
</p>
<p>
“I did not know that he had any thing left to
give you.”
</p>
<p>
“It is the last and best. A flower of spring!”
From a thick envelope in her work-basket, she
drew out a photograph, and, with its face upward,
laid it in Tessa’s hand.
</p>
<p>
A piquant face: daring in the eyes, sweetness on
the lips.
</p>
<p>
“Nan Gerard!” cried Tessa, catching her breath
with a sound like a sob.
</p>
<p>
“Naughty Nan! And they are to be married
here in this room, that I may be bridesmaid.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, how stupid I was!”
</p>
<p>
“Why, had you an inkling of it?”
</p>
<p>
“Several of them, if I had had eyes to see!”
</p>
<p>
“It came last night, and I lay awake all night,
thinking of the woman that Philip will love henceforth
better than he loves me.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, how can you bear it?” Tessa knelt on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_389'></a>389</span>
carpet at her side, with her head on the arm of the
chair.
</p>
<p>
“I could not, at first. I could not now, if I did
not love Philip better than I love myself.”
</p>
<p>
So her sorrow had become Miss Sarepta’s! She
drew a long breath, and did not speak.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t feel so sorry for me, dear. I have known
that in the nature of things,—which is but another
name for God’s will,—this must come. Even after
all the years, it has come suddenly. Will she love
my brother?”
</p>
<p>
“I am sure she will; more and more as the years
go on!”
</p>
<p>
“Every heart must choose for itself,” said Miss
Sarepta dreamily, “and the choice of the Lord
runs through all our choices.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa’s lips gave a glad assent.
</p>
<p>
A letter from Dinah that evening ended thus.
“Father is not at all well; I think that he grows
weaker every day. To-day he said, ‘Isn’t it <em>almost</em>
time for Tessa to come?’”
</p>
<p>
At noon the next day she was in Dunellen.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_390'></a>390</span><a name='ch26' id='ch26'></a>XXVI.—ANOTHER MAY.</h2>
<p>
May came with blossoms, lilacs, and a birthday,
she smiled all to herself over last year’s reverie; the
anniversary of the day in which she had walked
homewards with Mr. Hammerton and accepted Felix
in the evening followed the birthday; a sad anniversary
for Felix, she remembered, for he had her
habit of retrospection.
</p>
<p>
The days slipped through his mind, Laura had
told her; he would often ask the day of the week
or month. He had become quiet and melancholy,
seemingly absorbed in the interest of the moment.
He had greeted Tessa as he would have greeted
any friend, at their last interview, and she had left
him believing that his future would not be without
happiness. A year ago to-day, Mr. Hammerton had
said that a year made a difference, sometimes. And
this year! How the events had hurried into each
other, jostling against each other like good-humored
people in a crowd! A year ago to-day she
had thought of Nan Gerard as the wife of Ralph
Towne; to-day she was sailing on the sea, Professor
Towne’s wife; just as naughty as ever, but rather
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_391'></a>391</span>
more dignified. A year ago to-night she had held
herself the promised wife of her old tormentor, Felix
Harrison; since that night all his future had become
a blank, the strong man had become as a
little child; since that day Dine had found her
wonderful John; since that day Dr. Lake had had
his heart’s desire, and had been called away from
Sue, leaving her a widow; the hurrying year had
taken from Gus a long hope and had given him a
future of hard work with meagre wages. And Dr.
Towne! But she could not trust herself to think
of him. They met as usual, not less often; he had
grown graver since last year, and had thrown himself
heart and soul into his work: never demonstrative,
his manner towards her, had, if possible, become
less and less intrusive; but ever responsive,
having nothing to respond to, now, but a gentle
deference, a shyness that increased; a stranger
would have said, meeting him with Tessa Wadsworth,
that he was intensely interested in her, but
exceedingly in doubt of finding favor.
</p>
<p>
But Tessa could not see this; she felt only the
restraint and chilliness.
</p>
<p>
Once they were left suddenly alone together; he
excused himself and abruptly left her; clearly, he
had no reply to make to her letter; his love was
worn out with her freaks and whims.
</p>
<p>
“I deserve it,” she said, taking stern pleasure in
meting out justice to herself.
</p>
<p>
One afternoon in late May, she found herself on
the gnarled seat that the roots had braided for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_392'></a>392</span>
her; she had been gazing down into the brook and
watching a robin-redbreast taking his bath in it,
canary-fashion; she watched him until he had flown
away and perched upon a post of the Old Place
meadow fence, then her eyes came back to the
water, the stones, and the weeds.
</p>
<p>
“I always know where to find you!” The exclamation
could be in no other loud voice; she recognized
Sue before she lifted her eyes to the tall,
black-draped figure. If Sue had had a sorrow, there
was no trace of it in voice or countenance.
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t it dusty? How I shall look trailing around
in all this black stuff! What do you always come
here for? Do you come to meet somebody?”
</p>
<p>
“It seems that I have come to meet you.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you remember how you talked to me
here that day? I did keep my promise; I <em>was</em>
good to Gerald. Poor, dear Gerald! I have nothing
to reproach myself with.”
</p>
<p>
“Did mother send you here?”
</p>
<p>
“She said that I would find you between the end
of the planks and Mayfield. Come through the
grounds of Old Place with me. I want you to see
Mrs. Towne’s flowers and a new arbor that Dr.
Towne has been putting up.”
</p>
<p>
“No, thank you,” said Tessa rising and tossing
away a handful of withering wild flowers.
</p>
<p>
“You don’t know how lovely the place is. Dr.
Towne is always thinking of some new thing to do;
I asked him if it were for that grand wife that he
has been waiting so long for, and, do you believe, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_393'></a>393</span>
said ‘Yes,’ as sincerely as could be. He looked up
at his mother and smiled when he said it, too. I
believe they know something. Nan Gerard didn’t
get him any way! Won’t she have a lovely time
travelling! I always did want to go to Europe;
Gerald never would have taken me. I can’t believe
that he’s dead, can you?”
</p>
<p>
As Tessa was busy with her veil and did not
speak, Sue rattled on.
</p>
<p>
“Did you know that I’ve been making another
visit at Miss Gesner’s? They call their place Blossom
Hill, and it has been so sweet with blossoms.”
</p>
<p>
“Is she as lovely as ever?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” said Sue, doubtfully; “sometimes
I think that she is stiff and proud; the truth
is she doesn’t like to have her old brother pay attention
to me. She thinks that he is too old a boy
for such nonsense; but <em>he</em> doesn’t think so! Good
for me that he doesn’t. What are you walking so
fast for? I went to drive with him every day after
business hours; we <em>did</em> look stylish!”
</p>
<p>
“With Miss Gesner, too?” queried Tessa, in a
voice that she could not steady.
</p>
<p>
“No, indeed,” laughed Sue, “and that’s the beauty
of it. What did we want her along for? Of
course we talked about Gerald; we talked a great
deal about him. I told him how kind he had been
to me and how I adored him and how I mourned
for him. I am sure that I cried myself sick; Dr.
Towne gave me something one night to keep me
from having hysterics! I should have died of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_394'></a>394</span>
grief if Mrs. Towne hadn’t taken me to Old Place;
she was like a mother, and <em>he</em> was as kind as kind
could be! It was like the other time before I was
engaged to Gerald; I couldn’t believe that it wasn’t
that time. The Gesners were kind, too; I thought
at first that Miss Gesner really loved me; but she
began to be stiff after she saw her brother kiss me.
I couldn’t help it; I told him that it was too soon
for such goings on.”
</p>
<p>
“O, <em>Sue!</em>” cried Tessa, wearily. “And he loved
you so.”
</p>
<p>
“Gerald! Of course he did! But that’s all past
and gone! He can’t expect me never to have any
good times, can he? He didn’t leave me any money
to have a good time with! I’m too young to shut
myself up and think of his grave all the time. You
and father are the most unreasonable people I ever
saw! Why, he thinks because he thinks of mother
every day, and wouldn’t be married for any thing,
that I must be that kind of a mourner, too! It’s
very hard; nobody ever had so much trouble as I
do. I never used to like John Gesner, but you
don’t know how interesting he can be. He took
off my wedding ring one day and said it didn’t fit.
It always was a little too large. Gerald said that
I would grow into it,” she said, slipping it up and
down on her finger and letting it drop on the grass.
</p>
<p>
“There!” with a little laugh as she stooped to
look for it, “suppose I could never find it. Is that
what you call an omen, Tessa? Help me look!”
</p>
<p>
“No, let it be. Let it be buried, too.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_395'></a>395</span>
</p>
<p>
“There! I have found it. You needn’t be so
cross to me. I wonder why you are cross to me.
Gerald Raid once that you would be a good friend
to me forever.”
</p>
<p>
“I will, Susie,” said Tessa, fervently.
</p>
<p>
“You always liked Gerald. What did you like
him for?” asked Sue, curiously.
</p>
<p>
As the answer was not forthcoming, Sue started
off on a new branch of the old topic. “Mr. John
Gesner is going to Europe this fall, or in the winter;
he is going on business, but he says that if he
had a wife to go around with him that he would
stay a year or two. Wouldn’t that be grand?
Nan Gerard will have to be home when the Seminary
opens, anyway. It would be grand to travel
for two years.”
</p>
<p>
“Why does not Miss Gesner go with him?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, she wouldn’t leave Lewis. Lewis and Blossom
Hill are her two idols. Mr. John says that if
he were married, he would build a new house right
opposite, and he asked me as we passed the grand
houses which style I liked best. There was one
with porticoes and columns, I chose that. He said
that it could be built while he was away, and be
all ready for him to bring his bride home to. But
you are not listening; you never think of what I
am saying,” Sue said, in a grumbling, tearful voice.
“My friends are forever misunderstanding me.
Gerald never misunderstood me. What do you
think Dr. Towne said to me? He said that when
I am old, I shall love Gerald better than any one;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_396'></a>396</span>
that what comes between will fall out and leave
that time. Won’t it be queer? He said that women
ought to think love the best thing in the
world. I cried while he was talking. I can love
any body that is kind to me. When I told John
Gesner that, he said, ‘I will always be kind to
you.’ But you are not listening; I verily believe
that you care more for that squirrel than you do
for me!”
</p>
<p>
“See it run,” cried Tessa. “Isn’t it a perfect little
creature? If you will come and stay a week with
me, we will take a walk every day.”
</p>
<p>
“I can’t—now,” Sue stumbled over her words.
“Say, Tessa, Mr. Gesner has given me a set of
pearls. I can wear pearls in mourning, can’t I?”
</p>
<p>
“With your mourning, you can wear any thing.”
</p>
<p>
“Can I? I didn’t know it. It’s awful lonesome
at home; lonesomer than it ever was.”
</p>
<p>
“I would come and stay a week with you, but I
do not like to leave father; he is not so strong as
he was last summer.”
</p>
<p>
“You wouldn’t let Mr. Gesner come and spend
the evening; I haven’t asked him, but I’m going
to ask him the next time I see him.”
</p>
<p>
Dr. Greyson called for Sue late in the evening.
“I have the comfort of my old age hard and fast,”
he said; “she will never want to run away from
me again, will you, Susie?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” said Sue, with a hard, uncomfortable
laugh; “you must keep a sharp lookout.
I may be in Africa by this time next year.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_397'></a>397</span><a name='ch27' id='ch27'></a>XXVII.—SUNSET.</h2>
<p>
“Father is very feeble,” said Mrs. Wadsworth
one day in June. “I shall persuade him to take
a vacation. Lewis Gesner told him yesterday that
he must take a rest; do you notice how he spends
all his evenings on the sofa? I think that if Gus
would come and play chess as he used to that it
would rouse him.”
</p>
<p>
The week of Mr. Wadsworth’s vacation ran into
two weeks and into a month; Dr. Greyson fell into
a friendly habit of calling daily; Mr. Lewis Gesner
and Mr. Hammerton came for a chat with him
on the piazza as often as every other day, sometimes
one of them would pass the evening beside
his lounge in the sitting-room. Mr. Hammerton
amused him by talk of people and books with a
half hour of politics thrown in; and Mr. Gesner
with his genial voice and genial manner helped
them all to believe that life had its warm corners,
and that an evening all together, with the feeble
old man on the lounge an interested listener, was
certainly one of the cosiest.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_398'></a>398</span>
</p>
<p>
“Father, why have you kept Mr. Gesner to yourself
all these years?” Tessa asked after one of these
evenings.
</p>
<p>
“I would have brought him home before, if I
had known that you would have found him so
charming.”
</p>
<p>
“He is my ideal of the shadow of a rock in a
weary land,” she answered; “I do not wonder that
his sister’s heart is bound up in him. How can
brothers who live together be so different?”
</p>
<p>
“John is well enough,” said her father, “there’s
nothing wrong about him.”
</p>
<p>
“He makes me <em>creep</em>,” said Tessa, vehemently,
thinking of a pair of bracelets that Sue had brought
to show her that day.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Wadsworth lay silent for awhile, then opening
his eyes gazed long at the figures and faces
that were all his world; Mrs. Wadsworth’s chair
was at the foot of the lounge, the light from the
lamp on the table fell on her busy hands, leaving
her face in shadow; Dinah was reading at the table,
with one hand pushed in among her curls; Tessa
had dipped her pen into the ink and was carelessly
holding it between thumb and finger before writing
the last page of her three sheets to Miss
Sarepta.
</p>
<p>
“Oh my three girls!” he murmured so low that
no one heard.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Wadsworth, in these days, was forgetting
to be sharp, and hovered over him and lingered
around him as lovingly as ever Tessa did.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_399'></a>399</span>
</p>
<p>
“Doctor,” said Tessa, standing on the piazza
with Dr. Greyson late one evening, “do you think
that he may die suddenly?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“Any time, when the pain comes?”
</p>
<p>
“Any hour when the pain comes.”
</p>
<p>
“Does mother know?”
</p>
<p>
“I think that she half suspects; she has asked
me, and I have evaded the question.”
</p>
<p>
“Does he know it?”
</p>
<p>
“He has known it since March.”
</p>
<p>
Since he had wanted her to come home!
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps he has told mother.”
</p>
<p>
“She would only excite him and hasten the end.”
</p>
<p>
“She can be quiet enough when she chooses. I
am glad—oh, I am so glad—”
</p>
<p>
“Is the doctor gone?” cried Dinah rushing out,
“father wants him. He has the pain dreadfully.”
</p>
<p>
The paroxysm was severe, but it passed away;
Dr. Greyson decided to remain through the night;
he fell asleep in the sitting-room and was awakened
by Tessa’s hand an hour before dawn.
</p>
<p>
“Thank you, dear,” said Mr. Wadsworth to his
wife as she laid an extra quilt across his feet.
</p>
<p>
They were his last words. Tessa always liked
to think of them.
</p>
<p>
July, August, and September dragged themselves
through sunny days and rainy days into October.
Tessa had learned that she could live without her
father. There was little outward change in their
home, the three were busy about their usual work
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_400'></a>400</span>
and usual recreations; friends came and went; Tessa
wrote and walked; gave two afternoons each week
to Mrs. Towne, sometimes in Dunellen and sometimes
at Old Place; ran in, as of old, for a helpful
talk with Miss Jewett, not forgetting that she must
be, what Dr. Lake had said,—a good friend to his
wife. These were the busy hours; in the still hours,—but
who can know for another the still hours?
</p>
<p>
Mr. Hammerton and Mr. Lewis Gesner proved
themselves to be invaluable friends; Tessa’s warm
regard for Mr. Gesner, even with the shock that
came to her afterward, never became less; he ever
remained her ideal of the rock in the weary land.
</p>
<p>
Two weeks after her father’s funeral, she had
stood alone one evening towards dusk among her
flowers: she had been gathering pansies and thinking
that her father had always liked them and
talked about them.
</p>
<p>
There was a sound of wheels on the grass and a
carriage stood at the opening in the shrubbery; the
face into which she looked this time was not worn,
or thin, or excited; a dark face, with grave, sympathetic
eyes, was bending towards her.
</p>
<p>
“I wish that I could help you,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“I know you do. No one can help me. I do
not need help. I <em>am</em> helped.”
</p>
<p>
“The air is sweet to-night.”
</p>
<p>
“And so still! Do you like my pansies?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“Will you take them to your mother, and tell
her that I will come to-morrow.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_401'></a>401</span>
</p>
<p>
“I will tell her; but I will keep the pansies for
myself, if you will give them to me.”
</p>
<p>
She laid them in his hand with fingers that
trembled.
</p>
<p>
“Do they say something to me?”
</p>
<p>
“They say a great deal to me!”
</p>
<p>
“What do they say?”
</p>
<p>
“I can not find a meaning for you. They must
be their own interpreter.”
</p>
<p>
“But I may think that you gave them to me to
keep as long as I live.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; to keep as long as you live.”
</p>
<p>
“When you have something to say to me—something
that you know I am waiting to hear—will
you say it, freely, of your own accord.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, freely, of my own accord.”
</p>
<p>
“I regret to trouble you; but if you ever waited,
you know that it is the hardest of hard work.”
</p>
<p>
“I know,” said Tessa, her voice breaking; “but
you may not like what I say.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps you will say what I like then.”
</p>
<p>
“I will if I <em>can</em>.”
</p>
<p>
What had she to say, freely, of her own accord?
I think that it was the knowledge of what she
would say by and by when she was fully sure that
helped her to bear the loneliness of this summer
and autumn.
</p>
<p>
And thus passed the summer that she had planned
for rest. November found her making plans for winter.
Her last winter’s work had been sent to her,
one volume with its new illustrations, and the other,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_402'></a>402</span>
with but one new picture; her father had looked
forward to them; she sent copies to Elsie, Mabel, and
Sue, also to Felix Harrison and Mr. Hammerton;
Miss Jewett and Mrs. Towne made pretty and
loving speeches over theirs; Tessa wondered, why,
when she had written them with all her heart, they
should seem so little to her now.
</p>
<p>
“Where is your novel, Lady Blue,” Mr. Hammerton,
asked one evening.
</p>
<p>
“I think that I shall live it first,” she answered,
seriously. “I couldn’t love my ideal well enough
to put him into a book, and the <em>real</em> hero would
only be lovable and commonplace, and no one would
care to read about him—no one would care for him
but me.”
</p>
<p>
“It must be something of an experience to learn
that one’s ideal can not be loved, and rather humiliating
to find one’s self in love with some one below
one’s standard.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s what life is for,—to have an experience,
isn’t it?”
</p>
<p>
“It seems to be some people’s experience,” he
said, looking as wise as an owl, and as unsympathetic.
</p>
<p>
November found Sue making plans, also. Her
plans came out in this wise: she called one morning
to talk to Tessa; Tessa was sewing in her own
chamber, and Sue ran up lightly, as lightly as in
the days before Gerald Lake had come to Dunellen.
</p>
<p>
“Busy!” she said blithely, her flowing crape veil
fluttering at the door.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_403'></a>403</span>
</p>
<p>
“Not too busy. Come in.”
</p>
<p>
Sue talked for an hour with her gloves on, then,
carelessly, as she described some pretty thing that
the Professor’s wife had brought from over the sea,
she drew the glove from her left hand, watching
Tessa’s face. The quick color—the quick, indignant
color—repaid the manœuvre; the wedding
ring—the new wedding ring—was gone, and in
its stead blazed a cluster of diamonds.
</p>
<p>
“You might as well say something,” began Sue,
moving her hand in the sunlight.
</p>
<p>
“I have nothing to say. I wonder how you dare
come to me.”
</p>
<p>
“Why shouldn’t I dare? I know it seems soon;
but circumstances make a difference, and Mr. Gesner
has to go to Europe next month. He took the
other ring; I couldn’t help it—I wouldn’t have
kept it safe with a lock of his hair in a little box—but
he said that I shouldn’t have this unless I
gave him that.”
</p>
<p>
Tessa’s head went down over her work; she had
not wept aloud before since she was a little girl,
but now the sobs burst through her lips uncontrolled.
That ring that Dr. Lake had carried that
day in the rain not fourteen months ago!
</p>
<p>
Sue sprang to her feet, then dropped back into
her chair and wept in sympathy, partly with a
vague feeling of having done some dreadful thing,
partly with the fear that life in a foreign land
might not be wholly alluring; Mr. Gesner was
kind, but poor Gerald had loved her so!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_404'></a>404</span>
</p>
<p>
“O, Tessa! Tessa! don’t,” she cried. “Stop crying
and speak to me.”
</p>
<p>
“Go away from me. Go home. I will not speak
to you.”
</p>
<p>
For a moment Sue waited, then she arose and
moved towards the door, standing another moment,
but as Tessa did not turn or speak, she went
down-stairs, not lightly, hushed by the revelation
of a grief that she could not understand.

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_405'></a>405</span><a name='ch28' id='ch28'></a>XXVIII.—HEARTS ALIKE.</h2>
<p>
Early in December, in a snow-storm, Sue Lake
was married to John Gesner.
</p>
<p>
“Some things are incomprehensible,” declared
Mrs. Wadsworth, plaintively, looking at the snow,
“to think that she should marry an old beau of
mine. So soon, too. How a widow can ever
think—”
</p>
<p>
Tessa refused to see her married until the last
moment. “You must be a good friend to me
through thick and thin,” Sue coaxed, and Tessa
went the evening before; but the evening was
long and silent, for Tessa could not talk or admire
Sue’s outfit. The pretty brown and crimson chairs
were again wheeled before the back parlor grate;
but when Sue went out to attend for the last time
to her father’s lunch, there was no hilarious entrance,
and Tessa’s tears dropped because they
would not be restrained.
</p>
<p>
Sue’s talk and laughter sounded through the
hall; but Tessa could hear only “Good-by, Mystic;
you and I will have our talk another day.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_406'></a>406</span>
</p>
<p>
“Kiss me and say you are glad,” prayed Sue,
when they went up to Sue’s chamber to exchange
white silk and orange blossoms for travelling attire.
“It’s horrid for you to look like a funeral.
Mrs. Towne looks glum, and Miss Gesner had to
cry!”
</p>
<p>
The snow-flakes were falling and melting, as they
were falling and melting the day that Sue sang for
Dr. Lake; there was a fire in the air-tight to-day,
and by some chance the low rocker had been
pushed close to the side of the white-draped bed.
Sue seated herself in it to draw on her gloves and
for a last hurried, hysteric flow of words.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll write to you from Liverpool, Tessa. I hope
that we sha’n’t have any storms; I might think
that it was a judgment. I don’t want to be drowned;
I want to see London and Paris and Rome. Isn’t
it queer for me to be married twice before you are
married once!”
</p>
<p>
“You may be married three times before I am
married once,” said Tessa, opening a bureau drawer
to lay away an old glove box.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no, I sha’n’t! I’ll stay a rich widow, but
it was distressed to stay a poor one. Did I tell
you that Stacey is married? I was so delighted.
He’s got a good wife, too; real sober and settled
down. So I didn’t do so much harm after all your
fuming and fussing. I like to make people comfortable
when I can. And now we’re happy all
around just like a book. I wonder what will become
of you before I get back. I expect that Dine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_407'></a>407</span>
will be married. John is as tickled as he can be!
It’s lovely to be an old man’s darling; I am to have
my own way about every thing. I’m glad that he
wasn’t a widower; I hate widowers!”
</p>
<p>
A tap at the door summoned Sue. “Good-by,
dear old room!” she cried gayly. “You’ve seen
the last of me. I hope that you will get every
thing you are waiting for, Tessa.”
</p>
<p>
As once before on Sue’s wedding day, Tessa was
taken home in Dr. Towne’s carriage.
</p>
<p>
“I wonder if he knows,” she said.
</p>
<p>
“If he do it can not trouble him. He understood
her.”
</p>
<p>
“I am beginning to understand what the hurt
of love is.”
</p>
<p>
“What is it?”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you know?”
</p>
<p>
“I think that you are teaching me.”
</p>
<p>
“It is a lesson that we have learned together.
I used to wonder why God ever let us hurt each
other; perhaps that is the reason, that we may learn
together what love is!”
</p>
<p>
“Do not the students ever come to the end of
the chapter and learn the next lesson?”
</p>
<p>
“I do not know what the next chapter is.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps if we study hard we may learn that
together.”
</p>
<p>
“Great patience is needed to learn a lesson with
me.”
</p>
<p>
“I have a great deal of patience.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m afraid that I haven’t.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_408'></a>408</span>
</p>
<p>
“Having confessed our sins, suppose that we forget
them.”
</p>
<p>
“I can’t forget mine.”
</p>
<p>
“Can you forget mine?”
</p>
<p>
She tried to speak, but the words stumbled on
her lips.
</p>
<p>
“Look up and answer me.”
</p>
<p>
She could not look up; she could not answer.
</p>
<p>
“Tessa, say something.”
</p>
<p>
“Something,” she said childishly between laughter
and tears.
</p>
<p>
After a moment, during which her glove had
been unbuttoned and rebuttoned and he had leaned
back, holding the reins loosely, she spoke:
</p>
<p>
“You <em>have</em> been patient with me. I will not
have any more whims or fancies—I know now
beyond any need of reasoning—”
</p>
<p>
“What do you know?”
</p>
<p>
“Something very happy.”
</p>
<p>
“And now shall we be as happy as Sue and her
rich old lover?”
</p>
<p>
“Do you see this ring?” touching the emerald.
“It means that I must tell your mother that I am
satisfied, fully and entirely and thoroughly, before
I say ‘Yes.’”
</p>
<p>
“<em>Can</em> you tell her that?”
</p>
<p>
“Ask her and she will tell you.”
</p>
<p>
“Tessa, it has been a weary time.”
</p>
<p>
“I think that there must always be a weary time
before two people understand each other; I am so
glad to have ours come before—”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_409'></a>409</span>
</p>
<p>
The sun set behind clouds on Sue’s second wedding
day. Tessa tried to write, she tried to read,
she tried to sew, she tried to talk to her mother
and Dine; but failed in every thing but sitting idle
at one of the parlor windows and looking out at the
snow. There was a long evening in the shabby parlor;
quiet talk, laughing talk, and merry talk mingled
with half sentences, as many things both old
and new were talked about.
</p>
<p>
There were several happenings after this; one of
them, of course, was Dinah’s marriage to her wonderful
John; Tessa’s wedding gift to her was a deed
of the house in which they had both been born.
Another happening, perhaps, as much in the nature
of things as Dinah’s marriage, although the girls
could not bring themselves to think so, was their
mother’s marriage to Mr. Lewis Gesner. Tessa remembered
her promise to her father; she spoke
no word against it, and by repeated chidings kept
Dinah’s words and behavior within the limits of
deference.
</p>
<p>
Pretty little Mrs. Wadsworth was a radiant bride,
and the bridegroom was all that could be desired;
Mrs. Wadsworth prudently concealed her elation at
having married a man richer than Tessa’s husband
and with a residence far handsomer. Mr. Lewis
Gesner became the kindest of husbands and Miss
Gesner was a model sister-in-law.
</p>
<p>
On her own wedding day, one of Tessa’s grateful
thoughts was that her father would rejoice to
know that his “three girls” were in happy homes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_410'></a>410</span>
Miss Jewett’s congratulation was a dower in itself:
“Your fate was worth waiting for, Tessa.”
</p>
<p>
“Another poor man undone through you, Lady
Blue,” said Mr. Hammerton. “I might have known
that you were growing up to do it.”
</p>
<p>
“Is Tessa married?” Felix asked in his slow way.
“I hope that he will take good care of her.”
</p>
<p>
Another happening was the arrival of Mr. and
Mrs. John Gesner and son. The baby had been
born in Germany and could call his own name before
he came home to Blossom Hill.
</p>
<p>
The name was a surprise to Tessa: “Theodore,
because it has such a pretty meaning,” Sue told
her. “His father wanted John or Lewis, but I insisted;
I said that I would throw the baby away
if I couldn’t name him!”
</p>
<p>
She petted him and was proud of his rosy face
and bright eyes, but confided to Tessa that he was
a great deal of trouble, and that she hated that
everlasting “mamma, mamma.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t understand <em>you</em>, Tessa, you treat your
little girl as if she were a princess.”
</p>
<p>
That afternoon Tessa and the baby were alone
on one of the balconies at Old Place; baby in her
betucked and beruffled white frock and white shoes
was taking her first steps alone, and baby’s mother
was kneeling before her with both arms out-stretched
to receive her after the triumph.
</p>
<p>
Baby’s father stood in a window watching them;
but for the eyes that, just now, were like the woods
in October his face would have been pronounced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_411'></a>411</span>
grave; the white threads in his hair were beginning
to be noticeable, and before baby would be
old enough to drive all around the country with
him, his hair would be quite white.
</p>
<p>
“An earnest man with a purpose in his life,”
Dunellen said.
</p>
<p>
“Must you go out again so soon?”
</p>
<p>
Baby was crowing over her success, and the
mother’s arms were holding her close.
</p>
<p>
“There’s a poor woman with a little baby that
I must see to-night.”
</p>
<p>
“A girl-baby?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” smiling down at her, “a girl-baby.”
</p>
<p>
“Poor little girl-baby! <em>Poor</em> little girl-baby!”
she said, pressing her lips to baby’s hair.
</p>
<p>
“What were you thinking when the baby ran
into your arms just now?”
</p>
<p>
“I was thinking,” holding the beruffled little figure
closer, “that it isn’t such a hard world, after
all, for little girls to grow up in.”

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
